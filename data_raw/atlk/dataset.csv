,"The episode opens to footage of the sky while it is snowing. The camera pans down to reveal the dimly lit houses of the Southern Water Tribe, and three people, with one holding a lantern, near the city. They walk up a hilltop and gaze over the city. The scene pans to the left, showing the houses of the tribe. Switch to the front of a house as the three people arrive at it; the owner comes out, holding a lantern.",1,1,1
Tonraq,The White Lotus has honored my family by coming. [He inclines his head respectfully.] Thank you.,1,1,1
,"The man pushes open the door to grant the three Lotus members entrance to his house. Inside, a woman with two braids is sweeping the floor with a broom. As she notices the visitors, she stops.",1,1,1
Senna,"[Briefly bowing her head, and tugging her right braid behind her ear.] Welcome.",1,1,1
,"A shield hanging on the wall falls down and rolls across the ground to come to a stop near her. Cut to a shot of the three guests entering while they remove the hoods of their coats, revealing their faces. There are two men, one tall and one short, and a woman.",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,"We have investigated many claims, both here and in the Northern Tribe. All have turned out to be false.",1,1,1
,"Tonraq walks toward his wife and puts his hand over her shoulder. Upon hearing the doubt of the White Lotus leader, the duo smiles at each other.",1,1,1
Senna,"[Happily.] Then you should be happy to know, your search has come to an end. [Her husband nods in agreement.]",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,[Close-up of his unimpressed face.] What makes you so sure your daughter is the one?,1,1,1
Senna,Korra! Please come in here!,1,1,1
,"Suddenly, a slab of earth flies past the three members of the White Lotus, whose eyes all grow big in astonishment. Quickly turning to the right to see who bent the earth, a young girl stands within a round hole in the wall, regarding the members of the Order.",1,1,1
Korra,[Proudly raising her fist in the air.] I'm the Avatar! You gotta deal with it!,1,1,1
,"She jumps forward, and punches to the left, leaving a trail of fire. Performing a roundhouse kick, she sends a small fire arc toward the White Lotus members, making them slightly back away. She subsequently extends a small portion of the earth from the ground, causing the members to fall back even more. Sending another fire blast toward them, she sets the corner of the White Lotus leader's coat on fire. The leader immediately extinguishes the flames by retracting water from a small puddle on the ground. The camera pans up to show the impressed and surprised looks on the faces of the White Lotus members. Shift to a frontal view of young Korra, as she displays waterbending by raising a trail of water to her left. She proceeds to stomp the ground, levitating a chunk of earth, and slamming it away to her right. Finally, she bends a fire stream at the camera, blocking the entire camera's view of the scene. When the fire dissipates, a seventeen-year-old Korra, who is wearing red armor, emerges from it, and quickly kicks two fire blasts toward a man wearing the same armor. The man raises his arms in protection, but he is still sent flying and crashes to the ground. As Korra lands, two men, wearing the same armor as well, simultaneously shoot fire streams at her. The camera moves back to reveal that five people are observing the fight. The scene cuts to Korra as she is engulfed in a ball of flames and removed from view, but she dissipates the fire by moving her hands in a circular motion. As she takes on a fighting stance again, one of the men charges her, shooting three fire blasts at the Avatar, but she dodges the first one, dissipates the second with a grunt, dodges the third, and rushes forward. When the man jumps up and sends two fire arcs in her direction, Korra tumbles underneath the flames, and extends her leg, throwing him off balance. He flips over several times and crashes to the ground, but manages to stand up right away. Korra, now in between the two men, catches the fire stream of the man in front of her head on, while she also kicks back the guy that was charging her from behind, knocking him down. Retaliating with fire blasts of her own, she manages to knock down the firebender. Quickly turning back and forth to defend herself against incoming fire blasts from both men, she powers up her own attack and fires it at the man in front of her, sending him flying all the way up a nearby triangular roof of a small building near the training grounds, where he slides down unconscious, leaving a trail of smoke. The scene changes to the five spectators, who turn out to be an elderly Katara and four members of the Order of the White Lotus, one dressed in red.",1,1,1
Katara,[Impressed.] She's strong.,1,1,1
White Lotus leader,[Dismayed.] She lacks restraint.,1,1,1
,"Scene changes to the last firebender charging Korra while showering her with a fire stream. She runs toward the individual, smiling confidently. The camera moves back to show how Korra runs straight into the fire blast, parts it, and pushes the man's arms apart, effectively stopping his bending. She uses him as a step-up to propel herself into the air. From her elevated position, she kicks a fire arc in the bender's direction, and proceeds to shower him with a powerful fire stream as she descends. The man tries to block, but is thrown backward, where he sags down and slowly falls on his back with a light groan in defeat, smoking lightly.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Raising her hands in triumph.] Woohoo! [Cut to a shot of the unfazed spectators. An overview shot shows Korra running up to them.] Hey, why all the doom and gloom, people? [Frontal shot as she removes her helmet. One of her opponents recovers slowly in the background.] We should be celebrating! [Confidently raises three fingers.] Three elements down, [Holds one finger up.] one to go!",1,1,1
Firebending master,"[On a serious tone.] You're getting ahead of yourself as usual, Korra. We haven't decided if you passed your firebending test yet.",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,"Ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending, but completely ignored the spiritual side. [Side shot of a bored Korra.] The Avatar must master both.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Slightly bowing her head.] I haven't ignored it, it just doesn't come as easy to me. [More upbeat.] But that's why I should start training with Tenzin immediately. [Stretching out arm to emphasize her statement.] He's Mister Spiritual.",1,1,1
,"Cut to an aerial shot of Korra and the elders. One of the White Lotus members slightly moves forward to address Katara, who is standing at the end of the line-up.",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,"Do you believe she's ready, Master Katara?",1,1,1
Katara,"[Frontal view of the elders; Katara smiles.] Yes. If anyone can teach her what she needs to learn, it's Tenzin.",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,"Very well, Korra. It's time for you to begin your airbending training.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Jumps up, turning around her axis, in happiness and excitement.] Yes! Finally! [Realizing the elders are watching her, some of them with a dismayed expression, her look changes to a serious one.] I mean, [Clears throat and respectfully clasps her hands together and bows.] thank you all for believing in me.",1,1,1
,"Smiling innocently, she slowly starts walking away, still eying the elders. Unable to contain her excitement any longer, she breaks into a run and leaves the training grounds. Cut to a brief close-up of Katara smiling, before cutting back to Korra dashing off some stairs toward the stables, and opens the gate.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Excitedly.] Naga, you should have seen it! [A curled-up polar bear dog pricks her ears upon hearing her name, waggles her tail, and gets up to meet her master.] I kicked some firebender butt, and I passed! [Korra cuddles the polar bear dog by the head.] Tenzin will be here in a few days.",1,1,1
,"Korra scratches Naga's head. She laughs gleefully when Naga licks her face in return. Cut to an aerial shot of a compound at the Southern Water Tribe, tall, thick walls and a huge, richly decorated gate now surrounding it. The scene slowly moves to inside the walls, where Korra is riding Naga toward the gate. A White Lotus sentry walks toward the edge of his guard tower and looks down on Korra.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Looking up.] Just taking Naga out for a stroll. [Cut to the guard who looks unsure, before switching back to Korra, who has crossed her arms in annoyance at the guard's reluctance to open the gate; irritably.] Don't worry, we're not going far.",1,1,1
,"Complying, the guard walks back. The sun, now peering through the growing crack formed by the opening gates, moves over a broadly smiling Korra. A back shot of Korra leading Naga out the gates, changes to an overview shot of two White Lotus members eyeing Korra from atop a nearby mountain as she rides Naga over the large, snow-covered plains in the background. Cut to a side shot of Korra riding Naga.",1,1,1
Korra,"Naga, go! [Naga picks up speed.] That a girl. Go! Go! Go!",1,1,1
,"The camera pans out, as the polar bear dog starts running faster and faster. Switch to a frontal view of Korra moving up and down, swaying along with Naga's movements. Cut to an aerial shot of the Southern Water Tribe, as a flying bison heads toward it, losing altitude. Switch to a shot from behind Korra and Katara, who are watching the bison's arrival.",1,1,1
Ikki,"[Talking very fast; excitedly.] Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? [Camera pans up to show the belly of the flying bison as it starts it descent.] It looks like we're there. [Korra runs up looking very excited.] I know it, this is very familiar! Are we here yet? Are we here yet? Ooh, please tell me we're here!",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[As he directs his flying bison, Oogi, to land; sighing in relief and annoyance.] Yes, Ikki, [Frontal shot of Tenzin and his family atop the bison. Meelo is perched on his shoulders, gnawing on his head.] as I've been telling you for the last fifteen minutes, we are, [Relieved.] finally, here.",1,1,1
,"Cut to an aerial shot as Ikki and Jinora excitedly jump off the bison, riding off its tail on air scooters. Tenzin descends from his bison, as Katara walks up to him.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"Hello, Mother. [Tenzin holds his right arm in front of his chest as a way of greeting, with Meelo still on his shoulders, now pulling his father's ears. His daughters pull up on both his sides, with Ikki jerking his arm; solemnly.] I can't tell you how happy I am to see you. [Pleading in desperation.] Please, help me.",1,1,1
,Katara laughs warmly as Tenzin bows to allow her to take Meelo off his shoulders and into her arms.,1,1,1
Meelo,"[Frantically waving his limbs.] Unhand me, strange woman!",1,1,1
Tenzin,"That's your grandmother, Meelo.",1,1,1
,"Meelo nimbly pushes off on Katara's hand, who looks surprised, and somersaults above her head, landing on the ground behind her. He quickly dashes out from behind her, while Katara's expression changes from utter surprise to a loving smile.",1,1,1
Katara,[Smiling.] It's so good to see all of you.,1,1,1
Jinora,"[Slightly in awe.] Gran Gran, I've been reading all about your old adventures. I've been dying to ask you: What happened to Zuko's mom?",1,1,1
Katara,"Well, Jinora, it's an incredible tale--",1,1,1
,"To her surprise, she is interrupted by Ikki, who jumps right in between Katara and Jinora.",1,1,1
Ikki,"[Talking really fast, while jumping around.] Gran Gran, you look old. How old are you? And why is it so cold in the South Pole? [Jumping up and down clapping her hands, Jinora stands solemnly beside her, disappointed and annoyed.] Can we make a campfire, and all huddle around it, and tell scary stories, and make snowmen? [Frontal view of Katara, who appears unsure of how to respond to Ikki's enthusiasm.] And then can you make the snowmen move with waterbending and chase us? Wouldn't that be [Switch positions to show how Ikki is still jumping over-excitedly with Jinora looking embarrassed beside her.] fuuun? Huh? [Jinora lowers her head in shame, while Tenzin notices Pema slowly sliding down the bison's tail, and walks over to her.] Wouldn't it?",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Catching Pema's hands as she reaches the ground.] Pema, let me help you. Careful now, careful.",1,1,1
,"Tenzin helps his pregnant wife walk the first few steps, until she retracts her hand.",1,1,1
Pema,"Stop doting on me. I'm not helpless, I'm just pregnant.",1,1,1
,"Both Tenzin and Pema lay their hands on her protruding belly. The camera moves back to show how Pema descends the last few steps off the bison's tail. Katara walks up to her, and gives her a hug.",1,1,1
Katara,"The baby's strong. [Cut to Pema's stomach, as Katara keeps her hand on it. Camera pans above to show a smiling Pema.] I see another airbender in your future.",1,1,1
,"Suddenly, Pema's face becomes slightly unhappy. Cut to a side shot as she starts talking to Katara.",1,1,1
Pema,"[Slightly irritably.] All I want is one child like me, [Gleefully thinking about the prospect, smiling broadly.] a nice non-bender, who doesn't [Slightly gloomy again. Tenzin innocently starts pulling his beard, while Katara smiles comprehensively.] blast wind in my face every five seconds.",1,1,1
Meelo,"[Pema darts an irritated look at Meelo as he calls her attention.] Mommy, look, [Jinora rapidly darts out of the scene, Ikki is making a snowman in the background, and Meelo has covered himself completely in snow, before suddenly blasting it off himself using airbending; excitedly.] I'm a snowbender!",1,1,1
Pema,"[Looking dismayed, her head covered in snow. Shaking her head rapidly to remove it, leaving her hair in a mess. Pointing at her husband; slightly depressed tone.] Were Tenzin and his siblings this crazy when they were kids?",1,1,1
Katara,"[Calmly, with a joyous undertone.] Kya and Bumi certainly were, but [Putting her hand to her chin.] Tenzin has always been ... [Gesturing at Tenzin.] rather serious.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Slightly pouting.] Mother, please.",1,1,1
,"Katara smiles broadly at her son. Korra stands a few meters behind her, calmly waiting with her hands behind her back. Tenzin notices her.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"Korra? [Close-up of an excited Korra upon hearing Tenzin say her name. She runs up to him. Cut to a side shot as she pulls up in front of him. Tenzin puts his arms over her shoulders, his children running past them.] Look at you, so big and strong. [Close-up of Tenzin; impressed.] You've grown into quite the young Avatar.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Back shot of Tenzin and Pema.] Master Tenzin, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to get started.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Close-up.] Yes, well ... [He sighs.]",1,1,1
Pema,[Cut back to the back shot. Korra looks inquiringly at Pema.] You're going to have to tell her sooner or later.,1,1,1
Korra,[Sadly.] Tell me what?,1,1,1
Katara,"[Close-up; sadly.] You're not staying, are you?",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Cut to Tenzin, who sighs.] I'm afraid not. We're only visiting for the night. Then I have to return to Republic City.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Close-up of her face; sad and disappointed.] But ... no, you're supposed to move here. [Not understanding.] You're supposed to teach me.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Side-view of the foursome with the setting sun in the background.] I'm sorry, Korra. Your airbending training is going to have to wait.",1,1,1
,"Fade to black, before the camera changes to an aerial shot of the Southern Water Tribe at night.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Voice-over.] So, how long until you're ready to teach me airbending? [Cut to inside one of the houses where Korra, Tenzin, and three White Lotus members are sitting at a table.] A week? A month?",1,1,1
Tenzin,[Close-up.] It could be much longer.,1,1,1
Korra,[Disappointed.] I don't understand. Why are you making me wait?,1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Close-up.] I have a responsibility to Republic City. I am one of its leaders, and the situation there is very unstable right now.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Cut to Korra.] But you also have a responsibility to teach me. [Defiant.] Believe me, I'd be happy to find another airbending master, but you're the only one. [Sadly.] We're stuck with each other.",1,1,1
Tenzin,I wish there were another way.,1,1,1
Korra,"[Excitedly.] Wait, there is! If you can't stay here, then I'll go back to Republic City with you! It's perfect!",1,1,1
White Lotus leader,"Absolutely not! [Bangs hand on the table, shaking the contents on the table.] The city is far too dangerous. Avatar Aang tasked us with keeping you safe while you mastered the four elements.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Cut back to Korra; defiantly.] I get that, but I don't think keeping me locked up in this compound like a prisoner is what he had in mind.",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[Camera zooms back to a shot of the three.] I know this is difficult to accept, but it's not the right time for you to come to the city.",1,1,1
Korra,[Dismissive.] Whatever. [She abruptly gets up and leaves the room. The door slams shut as the White Lotus leader and Tenzin sigh.],1,1,1
,"Scene changes to the next day on the courtyard, where Tenzin, Ikki, Jinora, Meelo, and Pema are sitting on the sky bison, ready to take off. Everyone except Tenzin is waving to Katara, who waves back.",1,1,1
Ikki,"Goodbye, Gran Gran!",1,1,1
Tenzin,"[He tugs the reins.] Oogi, yip-yip!",1,1,1
,"The bison grunts and pushes off. Katara follows its ascent, wiping a tear from her left eye. Cut to a far-off shot of a cliff where someone is sitting at the rim. The camera slowly zooms in on it, and suddenly changes to a close-up shot of Korra perched atop Naga as Oogi flies past them. They both follow the bison's path with their gazes, Naga whimpering softly. Switch to a back shot of the duo as the camera zooms out, revealing that they are being watched by a member of the White Lotus. Cut to a close-up of Korra's sad expression. As she lifts her eyes toward the horizon where the bison flew toward, her look suddenly becomes serious and determined. Cut to an aerial shot of the lit stables at night. The slowly zooming in scene changes to a frontal view of Naga in her shed as she stands up when Korra comes running into the scene. Side-view of Korra, who takes Naga's saddle that hangs on a pole, and starts to saddle up her mount. As she is busy tightening the straps of the saddle, she is startled by a voice behind her.",1,1,1
Katara,"Nice night for an escape, isn't it?",1,1,1
,"Korra turns while standing up to see Katara, as the view switches to reveal Katara standing at the stable's entrance.",1,1,1
Korra,[Cut to Korra from below; saddened.] I have to leave. I have to find my own path as the Avatar.,1,1,1
Katara,"[Cut to a close-up of a contently smiling Katara. She briefly closes her eyes while tilting her head down. Looking forward again, speaking with an understanding tone.] I know you do.",1,1,1
,"Cut back to Korra, her looks changing from a sad to a grateful one. She tilts her head and closes her eyes as a silent thank you. The point of view changes to a back shot of Korra, showing Katara.",1,1,1
Katara,"Aang's time has passed. [Shaking her head from side to side.] My brother and many of my friends are gone. [Cut to a side shot of Katara, who smiles.] It's time for you and your generation to take over the responsibility of keeping peace and balance in the world. [Cut to a wider side shot of Korra and Katara, as the latter moves forward and places her right hand on the young Avatar's shoulder.] And I think you're going to be a great Avatar.",1,1,1
Korra,[Hugs Katara.] Thank you.,1,1,1
Katara,"[Close-up of Katara's face, still smiling with her eyes closed.] Goodbye, Korra.",1,1,1
,"Cut to a far-off shot of the Southern Water Tribe. Suddenly, a good distance away from the compound, in the front of the scene, the snow trembles and is pushed aside. Korra and Naga emerge from the tunnel. Korra waits for Naga to shake off the snow of her pelt before mounting her and riding away. Cut to an aerial shot of Korra hugging both her parents at once outside of their house. Light emanating from the open door of the house casts a long shadow over the snow.",1,1,1
Korra,"Mom, Dad. [Cut to the three of them, Korra's back to the camera, as they break up the hug. Her parents look sad.] I'll miss you.",1,1,1
Senna,[Her voice on the verge of breaking.] We love you so much.,1,1,1
,"Korra runs up to Naga, turning away from her sad-looking parents. She climbs on the polar bear dog, the black silhouettes of her parents hugging each other in the background as they watch their daughter. She casts one last look at her parents, and leads Naga away, riding in the opposite direction. Cut to footage of an engine-powered ship sailing in the sea. Cut to a Satomobile in the tonnage.

Naga's sleeping, with Korra resting against her flank, her arms held behind her back, looking content. Cut to a frontal shot of the pleased girl. Cut to an aerial shot of the ship sailing away from the Southern Water Tribe, before cutting to a wide side shot of the ship sailing in the distance the next morning. Switch to Naga and Korra, both asleep in the tonnage. Hearing metal-like sounds, Korra wakes up, glances around, and rubs her eyes.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Pushing against Naga's paw to wake her up; excitedly.] Naga, we're here!",1,1,1
,"Korra runs off camera. Scene switches to the ship's metal loading doors opening. Cut to a frontal shot of an excited Korra hiding behind some crates, shading her eyes against the bright sunlight, now peering in the dark room. She glances briefly forward and runs back toward Naga. Switch to dock workers unloading crates of the ship. Suddenly, Naga runs past them, Korra mounted on her, much to their surprise. Cut to a frontal shot as the polar bear dog dashes out of the tonnage, knocking over a stunned dock worker, who grunts as he falls down.",1,1,1
Korra,[Joyously waving at the knocked over dock worker.] Thanks for the ride!,1,1,1
,"Cut to an overview shot of the dock, as Korra rides away on Naga toward a large suspension bridge leading toward the city. Switch to a closer shot as she pulls up nearly at the base of the bridge. Two airships are floating above. The camera pans to the left, revealing the entire bridge and the skyline of Republic City with many buildings and skyscrapers.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Voice-over.] Wow, look at this place. [Cut to the vehicles on the bridge, honking as they are in a traffic jam.] I've never seen so many Satomobiles!",1,1,1
,"Cut to Korra riding toward the overview at the water, Aang's statue in front of her. Shift to a close-up of the statue. The zooming in close-up switches to a zooming in close-up of Korra, who is staring at it in awe.

Korra,"Air Temple Island. That's where Tenzin lives. [Cut to frontal shot of Korra and Naga, as the former pets the polar bear dog's head.] You ready for a little swim, girl?

,"Cut to a shot of airships above, as the camera pans below to an overview shot of a road with riding Satomobiles. A Satomobile honks and suddenly swerves to the left, as Korra and Naga come running into the camera in the middle of the road.",1,1,1
Korra,"Watch out, Naga! Look out!",1,1,1
,"Cut to a side shot as the polar bear dog only narrowly avoids a collision with a rapidly incoming truck. The truck brakes, and slides horizontally over the road, slamming into another Satomobile. As Naga runs on, Korra looks back at the damage they inflicted.",1,1,1
Pedestrian,Watch where you're going!,1,1,1
Korra,"[Side shot as Naga runs past a lot of pedestrians.] Whoops, sorry about that. Excuse us. Coming through. Heads up. Eh, sorry, we're new in town.",1,1,1
,"Naga comes to an open square and slows down, bending over to smell the ground, in order to pinpoint the exact location of the smell. Naga follows her nose toward a small food stall, its wall comprised of an orange cloth. The polar bear dog goes to the side of the stall and sticks her head through the curtains. Switch to a shot from inside the shop as first Naga's sniffing nose and her entire head appear. The food stall appears to be selling different kinds of meat. Korra sticks her head through the curtain as well. Naga opens her mouth to start devouring the food, but is halted by a stern command from Korra.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Sternly, crossing her arms.] Naga, wait. [Naga's eyes open wide and slant down in disappointment. She lies down, whimpering softly, as Korra leans back out of the curtains. Switch to a broader shot, showing how Korra slides off Naga and walks to the front of the stall. Naga's tail waggles excitedly. Cut to a shot from inside the stall, showing Korra picking up a meat stick, and the proprietor eyeing her in doubt.] We'll take one of everything, please.",1,1,1
Shopkeeper,[Harshly.] That will be twenty yuans.,1,1,1
Korra,Uh ... I don't have any money?,1,1,1
Shopkeeper,"[Infuriated, snatching the meat stick out of Korra's hand. Korra puts her hands in a karate-like position and makes an angry face.] Then what good are you to me?",1,1,1
Korra,"[Cut to a broader shot. Dejected, Korra walks up to a whimpering Naga and pets the neck.] Don't worry, girl. [Naga starts walking, her head down in disappointment. Korra tries to cheer her up.] The city's huge. I bet we could find a place to rustle up something to eat.",1,1,1
,"Korra keeps her hand on Naga's neck, looking down upon her pet, who walks on slowly, keeping her head down in sadness. Scene changes to Korra frying three fish on a stick with her firebending, as Naga searches the pond for more fish. As Korra takes the middle fish on a stick, Naga manages to catch a fish herself. The camera zooms out, revealing that Korra is fishing in the pond of a park. Shot cuts back to a broadly grinning Korra, who fries the fish again before blowing on it.

Korra,"[Uncertainly.] Oh, uh, yeah, sure.",1,1,1
,"He waggles up to Korra with big, weird steps, snatches a fish on a stick, and squats down, ferociously devouring the fish while smacking loudly.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Awkwardly.] So, do you ... live in [Points at the bush.] that bush?",1,1,1
Gommu,"Yes, presently that is what I do call home. Took me a while to procure a bush that beauteous. [The bush shines.] This park is quite popular with all the vagabonds.",1,1,1
Korra,"[Cut to Korra; unsure.] So there are a lot of you out here? I thought everyone in this city was ""living it up"".",1,1,1
Gommu,"[Chuckles.] Hey, you've got a lot to learn, newcomer. [Spreading his arms in a welcoming gesture.] Welcome to Republic City.",1,1,1
,"Korra arcs her eyebrows and gazes at Gommu, slightly unnerved. Suddenly, they hear the voice of a guard from a bridge over the pond nearby.",1,1,1
Guard,"[Blowing a whistle.] Hey, you! [Korra looks at the source of the sound in shock.] Stop! You can't fish here!",1,1,1
,"As the guard runs toward Korra and Gommu, the vagabond jumps up and runs toward his bush.",1,1,1
Gommu,"[Looking over his shoulder to Korra, who has not moved.] You best skedaddle!",1,1,1
,"Gommu dives in his bush, head first while Korra whistles on her fingers. Naga comes running toward her, and Korra runs a few steps along with the animal before hoisting herself on Naga's back, and rides away. The guard runs after her, blowing his whistle and waving his truncheon. Cut to a frontal shot of the guard as he reaches the spot where Korra and the vagabond were sitting moments earlier. He halts his pursuit, resting his hands on his knees, panting heavily. Gommu emerges from the bushes behind him and waves after Korra. Cut to a shot of Korra and Naga walking around the park. One of the passersby eyes Naga with interest.",1,1,1
Protester,"[Standing in front of a poster of Amon, talking through a megaphone.] Are you tired of living under the tyranny of benders? Then join the Equalists! [Switch to an overview shot of the protester, showing that twelve people have gathered to listen to him.] For too long, the bending elite of this city [Korra and Naga stroll into view and halt to listen.] have forced nonbenders to live as lower class citizens. Join Amon, and together we will tear down the bending establishment.",1,1,1
Korra,[Surprised.] What are you talking about? [Proudly.] Bending is the coolest thing in the world.,1,1,1
Protester,[Unimpressed.] Oh yeah? Let me guess: you're a bender.,1,1,1
Korra,"[Arrogantly.] Yeah, I am.",1,1,1
Protester,"[Provokingly.] Then I bet you'd just love to knock me off this platform with some waterbending, huh?",1,1,1
Korra,[Crossing her arms; irritated.] I'm seriously thinking about it.,1,1,1
Protester,[Addressing his listeners.] This is what's wrong with this city! Benders like this girl only use their power to oppress us!,1,1,1
,"The protester angrily glares at Korra, his spectators turning to her as well.",1,1,1
Crowd,[Raising their hands in anger.] Yeah! Get out of here!,1,1,1
Korra,[Dismayed.] What? I'm not oppressing anyone! [Pointing at the crowd.] You're ... you're oppressing yourselves!,1,1,1

Korra stops the water easily with one hand and sends it right back at the gangster, freezing the water over his head.

The ice around his head shatters as he sags down. Two Toed Ping recoils, as a ""that must have hurt""-look dons his face. Point of view changes to a shot from alongside the Satomobile, as the earthbender gangster, enraged by what happened to his friend, charges Korra by jumping up.

The man falls down onto a shop display before flopping on the ground where he lies still. Seeing two of his allies defeated, Two Toed Ping aggressively bends a large fire stream at Korra. The fire fills the entire camera, but is soon parted by a cockily grinning Korra. She jumps forward, deflecting the man's fire by holding two small flames in her palms. As she reaches the man, she grabs his hands. The man screams in fright.",1,1,1

Saikhan,"[Cut back to Saikhan, trying to retract the cable.] You can explain yourself all you like, down at headquarters.",1,1,1
,"Saikhan managed to withdraw the cables, and charges Korra. He bends the cables again at her, who ducks and tumbles backward. She is just in time to push herself on her feet again, as Saikhan smashes the ground with his cables where Korra was just moments before. Naga grunts, and comes to the defense of her owner, pushing Saikhan down from behind. There are more metalbending cops now, looking shocked and angered at the events occurring in front of them, and they rush forward to apprehend Korra. Switch to Korra mounting Naga, dashing away as the cops arrive, who give chase. Cut to a frontal view of Naga as she turns to the left into an alley. One of the cops launches himself forward as Naga slows down for the turn. Korra plants her left foot on his face and pushes him back, knocking him on the ground. One of the pursuers stays behind to take care of their fallen friend, while the other bends out a cable to bind an overhead wire. As soon as the cable secures itself, the scene changes to a back shot of the policeman hoisting himself off the ground. He nimbly lands on one of the overhanging cables, and slides over it in hot pursuit of Naga. He bends two cables at the running polar bear dog, but misses, smashing up the tiles of the street.

Close side shot of the girl, as the cables wrap themselves around her ponytail. She grunts in pain and angrily bends the water of the stream behind her, immediately turning it to ice, creating a wall. The cop, sliding over a cable, is pulled forward by the fact that he is still connected to Korra and she is still moving. He yells, and his expression changes to one of horror as he sees the icy obstruction up ahead. He crashes against the wall at high speed. The moment he does so, the scene changes to Korra, the cables releasing her hair. Gasping, she looks over her shoulder. The scene switches to her point of view, showing the ice slightly cracked where the cop crashed into it, his silhouette clearly visible. He slowly slides down with a squeaking sound.

A train just passes underneath the bridge. Frontal view as Naga leaps off the bridge and lands atop the train. Sliding forward, the animal nearly slips off, but she manages to remain on the roof. Korra, perched over Naga, sighs in relief. Sitting upright, she looks to the right, where Air Temple Island can be seen in the distance. Cut back to Korra, as a shadow passes over her face, and an alarm sounds. She looks up, and the camera pans up to reveal the airship of the metalbending cops. Korra straightens the reins with a determined look upon her face. Naga runs forward. As the train takes a turn to the right, Naga jumps off toward the roof of an adjacent building. As soon as the polar bear dog touches down, several cables are shot from up above, successfully binding the animal's paws and lifting it in the air. While being suspended, three more cables are bent down, binding Korra. The shot widens to show Korra struggling to get free, while Naga calmly hangs there in defeat.

Lin,[Seriously.] What of it?,1,1,1
Korra,"[A hint of amusement suppressed in her tone.] Well then, why are you treating me like a criminal? Avatar Aang and your mother were friends. They saved the world together.",1,1,1
Lin,[Aggressively.] That's ancient history. [Raising the volume of her voice.] And it's got diddly-squat to do with the mess you're in right now. [Stretches her left arm to emphasize her words.] You can't just waltz in here and dole out vigilante justice like you own the place!,1,1,1

Tenzin,"[Takes a deep breath. Arcs an eyebrow at Lin, and smiles. Switch to a side shot of Tenzin and Lin; charming.] Lin, you are looking radiant as usual.",1,1,1

Tenzin,"[Cut to Tenzin's face; seriously.] My relocation has been delayed. [Lowers his gaze toward Korra. Cut to Korra, who looks down guiltily.] The Avatar, on the other hand, will be heading back to the South Pole immediately, where she will stay put.",1,1,1

Lin,"Fine. [Crossing her arms; in an aggressive whisper, while Korra rubs her wrists in the background.] Get her out of my city.",1,1,1

Tenzin,"A time-honored tool that teaches the most fundamental aspect of airbending. Jinora, would you like to explain this exercise?",2,1,2
Jinora,"[Switch to a more far off shot, revealing part of the gates; she walks closer. Camera pans to the left, revealing the full extent of the gates as she talks.] The goal is to weave your way through the gates and make it to the other side without touching them.",2,1,2

The camera quickly moves back to include the gates in the shot the moment Tenzin thrusts his hands forward, releasing a burst of air. His coat flaps in the wind, and the gates start to spin rapidly. The camera switches to an aerial shot of the events, moving forward to the gates, now all spinning. Briefly switch to a side shot of Tenzin as he tranquilly holds up a leaf, before switching to a shot from his point of view, the leaf held between his thumb and index finger.",2,1,2

Tenzin,[Close-up.] I thought I made myself clear. I don't want you listening to this distracting nonsense.,2,1,2
Korra,"[Side shot of Tenzin and Korra as she walks up to him.] But it's their radio. And technically, you said I couldn't watch a match. [She gestures to the White Lotus Sentries as she walks up to him.] You didn't say anything about listening to one.",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Close-up.] You- [He grunts, recomposing himself for a moment and points at her.] ... you know what I meant! [Side shot; an unconvinced Korra standing rather aloof; annoyed.] Anyway shouldn't y-? Shouldn't you be in bed by now?",2,1,2

Korra,[Frontal shot; annoyed.] Whatever. None of this airbending stuff makes any sense to me.,2,1,2

Mako,[Side shot of Mako and Korra; irritably.] Useless.,2,1,2
Korra,"[Turning to Mako; impressed.] You guys were incredible out there! [Mako stats walking; points at Mako.] Especially you, Mr. Hat Trick!",2,1,2
,Korra's excited expression turns slightly sad at Mako's distant attitude.,2,1,2
Mako,"[Coldly.] Oh, you're still here?",2,1,2
Korra,"[Frontal shot of Mako with Bolin and Korra behind him, the latter glaring at him; irritably.] Oh, you're still a jerk?",2,1,2
Bolin,Ooh! [Chuckles and turns to Korra.],2,1,2
Korra,"[Turns to Bolin.] Anyway, [Excitedly.] I've been immersed in bending my entire life, but I never learned how to move like that! It's like there's a whole new style here! [Crossing her arms.] Think you could show me a few tricks?",2,1,2
Bolin,Ab-so-lutely!,2,1,2
Mako,"[Frontal shot as he is untying his protective gear; annoyed.] Right now? Come on, Bolin.",2,1,2
Bolin,"[Frontal shot; puts his hand besides his mouth and speaks a bit softer.] Just ignore him. [Louder.] Yeah, I could show you the basics. [Pensively puts his left hand to his chin.] I'm just not sure how my earthbending would translate to your waterbending, [Lightheartedly.] but we'll figure it out.",2,1,2
Korra,[Smugly.] Won't be a problem. [Crosses arms slyly.] I'm actually an earthbender.,2,1,2
Bolin,"[Awkwardly; eying Korra confusedly.] I'm sorry, no, no! I didn't mean to assume. 'Cause I, you know, I was just figuring ... with your Water Tribe getup ... that you are ... a Water Tribe ... gal.",2,1,2
Korra,"[Casually and smugly.] Nope, you're right. I'm a waterbender. And a firebender.",2,1,2
Bolin,[Holding hand to chin; confused.] Mm. Mm-hmm. I'm very confused right now.,2,1,2
Mako,"[Close-up of back of his head.] You're the Avatar, [Bows head, while closing eyes.] and I'm an idiot.",2,1,2
Korra,[Slightly mocking.] Both are true.,2,1,2
Bolin,"[Eyes widen in shock; Mako has turned around to face Korra and Bolin.] No ... way. [He turns to Mako, shields his face from Korra with his hand while pointing at her; whispering.] Th​e Avatar!",2,1,2
,Scene changes to a slowly zooming in shot of the entire arena from outside.,2,1,2
Bolin,[Voice-over.] All right! Let's see what'cha got!,2,1,2
,"Cut to a shot of Bolin, now in casual clothing, and Korra in the gym with two piles of earth coins between them. The camera pans to the right revealing a net hanging on the other side of the gym as Korra decisively turns and raises her arm, an earth coin following the movement. She knocks the coin away with her other hand, and quickly repeats the movement, knocking two of the earth coins at a net. The camera swiftly follows the objects as they slam in the net, before cutting back to Bolin. Korra is still standing in her solid earthbending stance.",2,1,2
Bolin,"That was great! Good power! But in a real match, you'd be a sitting turtle duck. [Cut to a frontal shot of a slightly disappointed Korra.] Not so upright and flatfooted! [Frontal shot of Korra and Bolin with Mako in the background as Bolin takes on a fighting stance, punching to air.] Stay light on your toes, right up until the moment when you need to dig in and strike. Then ... [He quickly raises two coins and almost immediately sends them flying toward the net.] pop, pop!",2,1,2
,"The camera stays with the two earth coins as they fly toward the net and nearly hit the exact same spot. Cut back to a side shot of Korra and Bolin; she stares at the net with open mouth, while he turns to her with a broad smile and gestures at the net, inviting her to give it another shot.",2,1,2
Korra,"[Slightly shocked.] Okay, let me try it again.",2,1,2
,"Korra looks decisive. Cut to a shot of her feet as she jumps from side to side, before throwing two coins at the net, mimicking Bolin's fast strikes.",2,1,2
Bolin,[Impressed.] Wow! Nice adjustment! [Pointing at Korra.] You're a natural at this.,2,1,2
Mako,[Aloof.] Not bad.,2,1,2
Korra,"[At Bolin, gesturing at Mako. Irritably; slightly down.] What's it take to impress this guy?",2,1,2
Mako,"[Close-up.] What? I said ""not bad"". [Close-up of Korra pouting at him. Cut back to Mako shaking his head; annoyed.] You know what, it's getting late. [Overview shot of Mako sauntering off with his hands in his pockets.] I think I'm gonna turn in. You kids have fun. [Close-up as he stops and glances back.] Nice to meet you, Avatar Korra.",2,1,2
Korra,"[Halfheartedly holding her hand up; sarcastically.] Yeah, been a real pleasure.",2,1,2
Mako,"[Back shot of Mako walking away; casually.] See ya upstairs, bro.",2,1,2
Korra,Upstairs? [Slightly impressed and jealous.] You guys live here?,2,1,2
Bolin,"[Frontal shot.] Yup. In the attic. It's nothin' fancy, but we have some great views! [Side shot of them both.] So, back to bending. Why don't you throw that combo one more time?",2,1,2
,"Korra immediately hops up and down a bit before successfully throwing two coins away. Switch to a shot of the net as the two coins hit it, and cut back to a frontal shot of Korra, who smiles broadly at her success. The scene changes as an airbending panel turns, and Korra is now back at Air Temple Island in her airbending clothes, with Tenzin and his children behind her. Korra looks a bit flustered. She takes a deep breath and sports an annoyed, determined look. Camera moves back to within the spinning gates as Korra sprints toward them. She manages to run inside the circle of gates, but is immediately hit by a spinning panel and knocked around again, while grunting in pain.",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Frontal shot.] Patience, Korra!",2,1,2
,"Korra is thrown against more gates. As she is knocked to her knees, she loses her temper and bursts into a violent firebending tantrum, burning and breaking most of the gates. The camera moves away, as some of the gates are knocked out of their sockets and break in two or are burned down. Switch to a frontal shot of Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo; the camera pans to the left, revealing Tenzin as well, all gaping wide-eyed at Korra's outburst. Cut to a close-up of a panting Korra amidst the still burning and smoking debris of the ancient airbending tool.",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Close-up; shocked, slowly, and somewhat quietly.] That was a two-thousand-year-old historical treasure! [Closing eyes in frustration.] What ... [Angrily shouting; his cape fluttering behind him.] What is wrong with you?!",2,1,2
Korra,"[Frontal shot; gesturing widely while speaking angrily.] There's nothing wrong with m​e! I've been practicing just like you taught me, but it isn't sinking in, okay? [Slants her head in frustration.] It hasn't clicked like you said it would!",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Frontal shot; on a calmer tone with his eyes closed.] Korra, this isn't something you can force. If you would only listen to me ...",2,1,2
Korra,[Frontal shot; angrily and louder.] I have been! But you know what I think? Maybe the problem isn't me! Maybe the reason I haven't learned airbending yet is because [Pointing at Tenzin.] you're a terrible teacher!,2,1,2
,"Switch to a frontal shot of Tenzin and his family as Korra storms off angrily. Tenzin, Jinora, and Ikki watch as she goes; Tenzin grunts in annoyance.",2,1,2
Meelo,"[Pointing a finger at Tenzin; energetically.] Yeah! You're a terrible teacher, Daddy!",2,1,2
,"Tenzin, Jinora, and Ikki all calmly eye Meelo as he runs forward, kicking and throwing some of the burnt up wreckage, imitating Korra's tantrum, while growling and screaming. Dejected, Tenzin bows his head while Jinora and Ikki both hug him to comfort him. Scene switches to a far off shot of Air Temple Island at sunset; flying bison are soaring around the temple's tower. Cut to Tenzin and his children gathered in the dining room for dinner. Meelo and Ikki look rather bored, while Jinora is reading a book, and Tenzin has his arms crossed while sporting an annoyed expression; Pema enters carrying a tray of small dishes.",2,1,2
Pema,[Puts down the tray on the table; upbeat.] Okay! Everyone here? [Frontal shot as she erects herself and looks around; motherly.] Wait. Where's Korra?,2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Side shot of Pema and Tenzin; frustrated.] Honestly, Pema, I am at my wit's end with that girl! I ... I don't know how to get through to her!",2,1,2
,Tenzin's expression changes to a dejected one as he closes his eyes and slants his head. Frontal shot as Pema kneels beside Tenzin and places a hand on his shoulder. He opens his eyes at her touch and glances at her.,2,1,2
Pema,"[Sympathetically.] Dear, the best thing you can do right now is to give Korra some space.",2,1,2
Tenzin,[His eyes widen as he looks to Jinora and Ikki; desperately pleading.] You must promise me that your teenage years won't be like this!,2,1,2
,Cut to a frontal shot of Jinora and Ikki. Ikki looks uninterested and Jinora looks bored as she lowers her books slightly and glances over it.,2,1,2
Jinora,[Emotionlessly.] I will make no such promises.,2,1,2
,"Jinora raises her book again, and resumes reading. Cut to inside the Pro-bending Arena as the camera pans down to reveal the lit playing field; three people are standing in the middle. Cut to the locker room where three people are talking in the back. Bolin is sitting on the bench, while Mako is leaning against the wall, both looking defeated. The door opens and Korra walks in.",2,1,2
Korra,"[Close-up of Mako's sad face, cut to Bolin's; voice-over.] I didn't miss your match, did I? You guys look like you lost already.",2,1,2
Bolin,[Frontal shot of the trio; dejected.] We might as well have.,2,1,2
Mako,[Angrily.] Hasook's a no-good no-show!,2,1,2
Referee,"[Opens door.] You got two minutes to come out ready to play, or you're disqualified. [Exits.]",2,1,2
Mako,"[Bitterly.] Well, there goes our shot at the tournament ... and the winnings.",2,1,2
Korra,[Points toward the other team in the room; Mako and Bolin briefly look up.] Can't you ask one of those guys to fill in?,2,1,2
Bolin,Nah. The rules say you can only compete on one team.,2,1,2
Korra,"Well, then ... [Places hand on chest.] how about me? I'm a top-notch waterbender, [Crosses arms.] if I do say so myself.",2,1,2
Bolin,"But, you're the Avatar. [To Mako.] Isn't that cheating?",2,1,2
Korra,[Close-up.] It isn't cheating if I only do waterbending.,2,1,2
Mako,No way. I'd rather forfeit than look like a fool out there.,2,1,2
Korra,"[Offended and sarcastically.] Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence.",2,1,2
Referee,[Enters again.] Time's up. You in or out?,2,1,2
Korra,"[Excitedly, instantly responding.] We're in!",2,1,2
Mako,[Just as quickly.] We are?,2,1,2
Bolin,[Excitedly getting up while Korra runs toward the closet. Just as quickly.] Yes!,2,1,2
Mako,"[Pointing at Korra; objecting.] Hey, I didn't agree to this!",2,1,2
Korra,You can thank me later. [Opens the closet with the uniforms to get changed.],2,1,2
Mako,[Close-up of his dismayed face.] This girl is crazy.,2,1,2
,Scene cuts to a side shot of the arena as the Fire Ferrets take their places at the center line.,2,1,2
Shiro Shinobi,[Voice-over.] Looks like the Fire Ferrets have ferreted out a last minute replacement waterbender. [Cut to a closer side shot of the two teams. Korra's fidgeting at her outfit which is way too big.] Let's see if she's another diamond in the rough like the brothers from the school of hard knocks!,2,1,2
Mako,"[Close side shot of the Fire Ferrets as the teams take on a fighting stance.] Don't do anything too fancy or aggressive. [Looks at Korra.] In fact, don't do anything. Just try not to get knocked off the ring.",2,1,2
Korra,"You got it, captain.",2,1,2
,"Korra's helmet slips awkwardly, but she soon adjusts it.",2,1,2
Referee,[Close-up.] Players! Are you ready?,2,1,2
,"The camera quickly zooms out as the referee holds up his hand and blows his whistle. Close-up of Korra while a bell is rung, signaling the start of the match. Korra smiles confidently and immediately conjures a powerful water blast with her foot which she uses to knock the opposing waterbending player over the side of the ring, who screams before landing in the pool. Close-up of the remaining firebender and earthbender player as they stare wide-eyed at the spot their teammate was just knocked over the ropes. Cut to Mako who grits his teeth and facepalms, before switching to a broader shot of an excited Korra running around, waving her hands in the air to celebrate her move.",2,1,2
Korra,[Excitedly.] Woohoo! Man overboard!,2,1,2
Referee,"[Blows his whistle. Close-up as he points his finger.] Fire Ferret waterbender, penalty! Move back one zone!",2,1,2
Korra,[Frontal shot; confusedly addressing the referee.] What? Why?,2,1,2
Mako,[Frustrated; gesturing at the sides of the ring.] You're only allowed to knock players off the back of the ring! Not over the sides!,2,1,2
Korra,[Apologetically.] Oh. Whoops.,2,1,2
,"Aerial shot of the playing field as Korra moves back one zone, and the waterbender that was knocked over the side, rejoins his team mates.",2,1,2
Shiro Shinobi,"[Voice-over.] And we're back in action after that hiccup, but I'm not so sure this replacement player knows what she's doing.",2,1,2
,"Back shot of Korra as the bell signaling the game rings again, and the teams immediately start to attack each other. Switch to a side shot of Korra as she pulls up some water and fires it away.

Shiro Shinobi,"[Voice-over; shot of the scoreboard where the first tube lights up blue.] The Platypus Bears take round one! [Bell rings again and the Platypus Bears immediately start attacking.] The Platypus Bears know a green player when they see one, and they are focusing the brunt of their bending on this poor girl!",2,1,2
,"Frontal shot of Korra as she gets assaulted by all the elements of the other team. She used her waterbending to deflect the water blast of the Platypus Bears before conjuring up a shield to block a fire and earth attack; she is slight knocked back by the force of it. She quickly blocks another water blast with one of her own, but is kept on the defensive all the time. Frontal shot of Korra as she takes on a defensive stance; switch to a back shot as the opposing fire and earthbender ready their attacks. Frontal shot of Korra. She clenches her teeth and grunts with effort as she angrily raises two coins beneath her to protect herself against a triple water, fire, and earth combo.

Referee,"[Voice-over; back shot of Korra as she looks shocked over her shoulder, and turns, looking around.] Foul! I ... think.",2,1,2

Shiro Shinobi,"[Voice-over.] Did I see that right? [Scene shifts back to Air Temple Island, where the White Lotus guards are listening to the game on the radio.] Hold on, folks, we're just waiting for the referee's official call, but ... [Closer shot of the guards as Tenzin approaches their table.] I-I think this replacement player could be ... no, there's no way!",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Frontal shot of the guards all looking bewildered.] Pardon me, everyone, have you seen Korra this evening? She's not in her room.",2,1,2
Shiro Shinobi,"[Through the radio.] You've gotta be kidding me! [Camera zooms up to the radio.] She's the Avatar, folks! [Switch back to the shocked guards; a female one takes a sip of her drink, but immediately spits it out over the guard opposite of her after hearing that.] Playing in a pro-bending match! [Cut to a close-up of Tenzin as his eyebrows twitch in anger and he slightly turns red.] Can you believe that?",2,1,2
Tenzin,[Angrily.] I'll get her myself!,2,1,2
,"As Tenzin turns, a gust of wind swirls some leaves around. Cut to a frontal shot of the referee in the pro-bending stadium.",2,1,2
Referee,[Raises his hand; solemnly.] The Avatar will be permitted to continue so long as she solely bends water!,2,1,2

The other Platypus Bears also direct their attacks in the same direction as the coin.",2,1,2
Shiro Shinobi,"[Voice-over.] This girl may be the Avatar, but she's no pro-bender and the Platypus Bears are intent on exploiting that weakness!",2,1,2
,"Side shot of Korra as she deflects the coins with a water whip, as well as the fire blast and water bullet. She nimbly back flips under another coin and water attack, before crossing her arms before her face to protect herself from a fire blast.",2,1,2
Shiro Shinobi,"[Voice-over.] They're giving her their best, and her best ain't good enough to stop it!",2,1,2
,"Swift back shot of Korra as the Platypus Bears launch another wave of attacks, before switching to another side shot as Korra is hit in the side by a fire blast, knocked out of balance by an earth coin in the stomach, and thrown back by a water blast against the head. Shot from right over the floor of the playing field as Korra bounces past, and falls over the rim. Frontal shot of Korra as she tumbles in the water.",2,1,2

Korra,[Decisively.] No! I'm kind of in the middle of something.,2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Back shot; Tenzin slowly turns around.] I have tried my very best to get through to you by being gentle and patient, [Gradually becomes angry.] but clearly the only thing you respond to is force! So I am ordering you to come back to the temple right now!",2,1,2
,Tenzin points down to emphasize his words. Switch to a shot from his point of view of Korra.,2,1,2
Korra,"[Defiantly.] Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending? [Side shot; angrily.] You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!",2,1,2
Tenzin,What? That is a ludicrous suggestion! [Points at Korra.] The Avatar needs to learn airbending! It is not optional!,2,1,2
Korra,"[Frontal shot, gestures at the pro-bending playing field behind her.] No! This is what I need to learn! Modern styles of fighting!",2,1,2
Tenzin,"[Frontal shot.] Being the Avatar isn't all about fighting, Korra! [Slightly leans toward her.] When will you learn that?",2,1,2
Korra,[Promptly turns around.] I have a match to go finish.,2,1,2
,Switch to a broad side shot of the two as Korra walks away from Tenzin to the nearby elevator.,2,1,2

Korra,[Side shot; the protester glares at her while clenching his fists.] Shut your yapper and listen up. My friend got kidnapped by some chi blockers. Where'd they take him?,3,1,3
Protester,[Frontal shot; uncooperatively crossing his arms.] I have no idea what you're talking about.,3,1,3
Korra,"[Side shot; threateningly.] Oh, I think you do.",3,1,3
,"The shot moves back to a broad side shot of the entire party as Korra lifts her leg in the air and slams it down with a half-moon kick. The earth underneath the table rises, catapulting it in the air and throwing the protester off. Shot to a ground view of the airborne table that flips in the air. Leaflets with a picture of Amon are thrown off and rain down upon the area. Switch to a broad side shot as the leaflets fall upon everyone, the protester and his friend still lying on the ground.

Mako,"[Panning up shot of the leaflet.] ""Witness the Revelation tonight, nine o' clock"". [Turning to the protester.] What's this ""Revelation""?",3,1,3
Protester,[Frontal shot; irritably.] Nothing that concerns the likes of you two!,3,1,3
,The protester squeals as Korra grabs the hem of his shirt and pulls him up. Cut to a side shot of the threesome.,3,1,3
Korra,[Lifting the man off the ground; threateningly.] You better believe it concerns us. Spill it.,3,1,3
Protester,"[Frightened.] No one knows what the Revelation is! And I have no idea what happened to your friend. [Arrogantly.] But if he's a bender, then my bet is he's getting what's coming to him.",3,1,3
Mako,[Slight air view.] Where's it happening?,3,1,3
,"At the sound of a whistle, Mako and Korra turn to their left. Cut to a back shot of them, revealing a policeman, running toward them, while blowing his whistle again.",3,1,3
Policeman,[Yelling.] Hey! What's going on over there?,3,1,3
Protester,[Frontal shot of the threesome; screaming.] The Avatar's oppressing us. Help!,3,1,3
Korra,[Tossing the protester away.] Let's scram.,3,1,3
,"Korra and Mako run off, but Mako quickly snatches up a handful of leaflets before vaulting on Naga; Korra was already perched upon the animal, with Pabu sitting in front of her. As soon as Mako's on, Naga takes off. Cut to a sight of a trolley passing over a bridge. Cut to Mako and Korra sitting on a bench underneath the bridge. Korra holds one of the leaflets, while they're both looking at several others spread out over the floor. There hangs a map of the city next to Korra on the wall.",3,1,3
Korra,[Puzzled.] Why didn't the Equalists put a location on these?,3,1,3
Mako,"[Close shot; Korra eyes the leaflet she is holding in any way possible, her look changing from wonder to annoyance.] Probably because they don't want just anyone waltzing in to their big [Mockingly looking up.] ""Revelation"", [Dejected.] whatever that is. [Grabbing his chin; pensively.] I bet the information is hidden on here somehow. Look at the backs. [He bends down to the leaflets on the ground and grabs two of them, turning them over and putting them together.] There's four different images.",3,1,3
Korra,"[Close shot.] So, [Turns to Mako with a smile.] it's a puzzle?",3,1,3
Mako,"[Frontal shot; something dawns on him.] Yeah, of a map!",3,1,3
,"He excitedly gets on his feet. Side shot as he walks over to the map next to Korra, four leaflets in hand. Switch to a back shot of the duo as he starts to compare them to the city map, moving the image over different areas. Closer shot of the map as he finds the right location. One of the leaflets has a red spot on its back, indicating the meeting place.",3,1,3
Mako,[Voice-over.] Bingo. [The camera zooms toward the red dot on the back of the leaflets; excited voice-over.] That must be where it's going down.,3,1,3
,"Cut to a frontal shot as the teenagers smile contently at one another. Camera moves slightly closer to Korra's confident grin.

Mako,This is the place.,3,1,3
,"Frontal shot of the duo as Mako puts on a hat to fit his disguise outfit and Korra puts on a flapper hat, tugging her ponytail underneath it, before walking toward the other factory building. Cut to a shot of the entrance, where a doorman in checking the invitation of a citizen, who is holding up the leaflet. Approving it, he moves aside to let the man in, and immediately turns his attention to the man that was waiting, who takes out his own leaflet and shows it. Switch to an approaching Korra and Mako. Korra moves closer and grabs hold of his arm.",3,1,3
Mako,[Annoyed.] What are you doing?,3,1,3
Korra,[Hushed.] We'll attract less attention this way.,3,1,3
Doorman,[Frontal shot; crossing his arms.] This is a private event. No one gets in without an invitation.,3,1,3
Korra,Uh ... invitation?,3,1,3
,"Close-up as the doorman looks suspiciously at Korra and Mako, cocking an eyebrow.",3,1,3
Mako,"[Takes a leaflet out of his pocket, showing it to the doorman; innocently.] You mean this?",3,1,3
Doorman,"[Takes the leaflet, eyes it, and moves out of the way; friendly.] The Revelation is upon us, my brother and sister.",3,1,3

,"Cut to a level view of the stage as Amon emerges from a trapdoor in the stage with a line of Equalists behind him under loud approving cheers of the crowd. A spotlight is turned on, illuminating the Equalist leader, and the camera zooms in to a close-up.

Amon,"[Back-shot.] My quest for equality began many years ago. [Frontal shot; takes the microphone out of his stander.] When I was a boy, my family and I lived on a small farm. We weren't rich, and none of us were benders. [Shot of the listening crowd.] This made us very easy targets for the firebender who extorted my father. [Back-shot of Amon as he walks to the right on the stage.] One day, my father confronted this man, but when he did, [Frontal close-up.] that firebender took my family from me. Then, he took my face. [The crowd gasps in astonishment; very close shot of the mask he wears.] I've been forced to hide behind a mask ever since. [Korra and Mako exchange a glance; cut back to Amon.] As you know, the Avatar has recently arrived in Republic City. [Switch to Korra and Mako as the crowd boos; Korra hides her face in Mako's red scarf that she's wearing.] And if she were here, [Back to a front shot of the stage.] she would tell you that bending brings balance to the world. But, she is wrong. The only thing bending has brought to the world, is suffering. [Amon repeatedly points into the audience.] It has been the cause of every war in every era. [In the audience, Korra grits her teeth in anger.] But that is about to change. [Korra looks surprised; cut to a back-shot of Amon.] I know you have been wondering, ""What is the Revelation?"" [Frontal shot.] You are about to get your answer. [Korra and Mako exchange a worried glance.] Since the beginning of time, [Overview shot of the stage.] the spirits have acted as guardians of our world, and they have spoken to me. [Frontal shot.] They say the Avatar has failed humanity. [Korra sports a look of anger again; cut back to Amon.] That is why the spirits have chosen me to usher in a new era of balance. They have granted me a power [Korra and Mako exchange a glance and Korra nods.] that will make Equality a reality. The power to take a person's bending away. [Close-up.] Permanently.",3,1,3
,The audience gasps. Cut to a close-up of Korra's eyes widening in horror.,3,1,3
Korra,[Frontal shot.] That's impossible. [Turning to Mako.] There's no way.,3,1,3
Mako,[Whispering.] This guy's insane!,3,1,3
Amon,"[Far off side-view of Amon.] Now, for a demonstration. Please welcome, Lightning Bolt Zolt.

Lightning Bolt Zolt,"[To the crowd; annoyed.] Ah, boo yourself!",3,1,3

Amon,"[Frontal shot of the entire stage.] Zolt has amassed a fortune by extorting and abusing nonbenders. [Close-up.] But his reign of terror is about to come to an end. [Broad frontal shot.] Now, in the interest of fairness, [The Lieutenant takes off the rope binding Lightning Bolt Zolt.] I will give Zolt the chance to fight to keep his bending.",3,1,3
,Amon moves away from Zolt and the Equalist guard pushes Zolt in the opposite direction Amon took to bring some space between the two fighters.,3,1,3

,"Lightning Bolt Zolt immediately directs a fire blast at Amon. Backshot of Zolt as Amon nimbly dodges every blast that Zolt throws at him, gradually coming closer. A side shot of Amon dodging the rounds of fire blasts switches to a frontal shot of Zolt who surges forward while generating lightning. He fires the bolt at the Equalist leader who ducks underneath it, grabs hold of Zolt's wrist, and twists it around and away from him. The lighting crashes into the stage, before hitting the ceiling as Amon turns his hands further away. Close side shot of Zolt as his neck is being grabbed by Amon's hand. Switch to a frontal shot of the two man, lightning still shooting out of Zolt's fingers, as Amon moves his hand from Zolt's wrist to his forehead.

The crackling lightning changes into a large fire blast, and stops entirely. Cut to a frontal shot of the two men. Amon lets go of Zolt, who collapses weakly onto the ground.

Lightning Bolt Zolt,[Frontal shot; saddened and shocked while looking at Amon.] Wha ... what did you do to me?,3,1,3
Amon,[Frontal shot; in a commanding tone while looking at Zolt.] Your firebending is gone. Forever. [The audience gasps and the camera zooms toward Korra's worried expression; cut back to a broad shot of the stage.] The era of bending is over. A new era of Equality has begun!,3,1,3
,"The crowd cheers madly. Switch to the other captured benders. One of the Equalist guards releases the second captured bender, Shady Shin, and kicks him forward to face Amon.",3,1,3
Shady Shin,[Frightened.] No! Ugh!,3,1,3
Korra,[Frontal shot. Turns to Mako; urgently.] Any ideas yet?,3,1,3
Mako,"[Frontal shot, nodding at her.] I think so, see those machines? [Looks toward the machines on the walls; voice-over.] They're powered by water and steam. If you create some cover, I can grab Bolin [Frontal shot of the teenagers.] without anyone seeing. Then, we duck out of here.",3,1,3
Korra,"Works for me. [Taps Mako on the shoulder as he moves to walk away.] Mako, good luck. [They shake hands.]",3,1,3
Mako,"You, too.",3,1,3
,"Korra emerges at the side of the pleased crowd, carefully moving through one of the side exits. Cut to a shot of her running through a hallway filled with machines.

Doorman,"[Voice-over.] Hey, you!",3,1,3

The bender is grabbed by the collar and pulled to his feet. He gasps, and Bolin is left for last. Cut to a frontal shot of the doorman.",3,1,3
Korra,"[Frontal shot. Looking innocently; voice slightly higher pitched than normal.] Is there a problem, my brother?",3,1,3
Doorman,[Frontal shot; gruffly.] What are you doing back here?,3,1,3
Korra,[Frontal shot; innocently.] Uh ... looking for the bathroom?,3,1,3
,"Korra cracks an innocent grin. Switch to a ground back-shot of the doorman as he takes out a wrench. Cut to Korra's eyes, which have switched from a look of faked innocence to a look of focus.

Mako,[Impatiently.] Come on ...,3,1,3
,"Cut back to Korra as she ducks underneath another violent swing of the doorman's wrench that hits the pipes instead, denting them. Close-up of a now hatless Korra who takes off Mako's scarf and uses it to tie around the doorman's hand as he aimed another swing at her. Wider shot as Korra uses the scarf to pull the man into a turn, flinging his entire body into the machine, knocking off all the vents that were holding down the steam. Through three open pipes, steam pores out and fills the room. Ground, frontal shot as Korra looks at the steam.",3,1,3
Korra,[Lightheartedly.] Thanks. This should be enough.,3,1,3
,"She runs forward to the camera. Cut to a frightened Bolin as an Equalist guard moves toward him. As the Equalist start to fumble at his ropes, Bolin anxiously looks back, whimpering softly. Once he is free, he is pulled on his feet and thrown forward. Switch to a back-shot as he stumbles forward on the stage while the bender Amon just took care of slumps down in exhaustion.

The moment she has enough, she directs it all in front of her with a powerful swipe of her hand. Cut to a back-shot of Bolin. An explosion to his left makes him duck for cover; under loud screams of the crows, steam starts to pour in to the meeting room. Quick frontal shot of a shocked Bolin as he looks at what is going on.

Cut to a side shot of outside the factory where a door is being flung open, scaring off several birds. The two brothers emerge from the balcony exit and run over to a ladder; switch to a ground shot as they start descending it, Bolin being the first. An aerial shot of the balcony shows another person emerging from the door and running over to the ladder. Brief frontal shot of Mako looking up changes to a ground shot from his point of view to show an Equalist fighter, the Lieutenant, twirling his kali sticks and slamming them into the ladder, sending an electricity charge through it. Mako and Bolin scream in shock and pain and fall down, landing with grunts. The Lieutenant jumps down from the balcony, his kali stick charged. A far off side shot shows that he lands and immediately releases the charge, forcing the brothers to jump away. Frontal shot of first Bolin, followed by Mako, as they erect themselves, having pushed themselves out of the way of the Lieutenant's attack. Mako raises his fist and goes on the offensive, launching a fire jet at the crouched Lieutenant from his left fist. Frontal shot of the Equalist as he runs off to avoid the blast. He attacks Mako with his kali sticks, electricity trailing behind them as he rapidly swings them around. With a few fast hits, Mako is floored, and the Lieutenant turns to Bolin. Switch to a back-shot of the Lieutenant. Bolin flips over and uses his own momentum to hurl a slap of earth at the Lieutenant with a grunt of focus, who jumps up, twirling out of its path. He does a similar evasive maneuver to avoid the second block a grunting Bolin threw at him, before charging the earthbender. Frontal shot of an alarmed-looking Bolin; switch to a back-shot of him as he conjures up a large earth wall to protect himself. The Lieutenant performs a round off, before back flipping and somersaulting over Bolin's wall. He lands behind a shocked Bolin, who quickly turns to face him, and after delivering several quick hits with his charged kali sticks, the Lieutenant jabs him with the two electrified kali sticks and electroshocks him until he falls to the ground unconscious. Suddenly, Mako emerges from beside the wall, using the adjacent building to push himself off in the Lieutenant's direction, sending a fire slice in his direction. The Lieutenant dodges, and Mako kicks out another fire slice while grunting in effort, knocking over Bolin's wall with his attack. The Lieutenant charges Mako again and after a quick exchange of some blows striking air from both parties, the Lieutenant lands a hit with a kali stack in Mako's stomach, flinging him back with a grunt of pain. As Mako is pushed up against the wall, the Lieutenant charges and twirls both his weapon sticks and jabs Mako's chest, electroshocking him into unconsciousness. Wider shot as Mako slumps onto the ground as well; the Lieutenant is looking at Bolin's unconscious form.",3,1,3
Lieutenant,"You benders need to understand, there's no place in the world for you anymore.",3,1,3
,"A pillar of rock shoots up beside the Lieutenant and thrusts him brutally against the building. He slams hard against the metal, his two kali sticks are knocked out of his hands, and he falls down onto the ground. As he tries to get up, the camera switches to his point of view to show Korra standing there in an earthbending pose.",3,1,3
Korra,I wouldn't count us out just yet. [The Lieutenant collapses; Korra whistles on her fingers.] Naga!,3,1,3

Lieutenant,[Wide shot as Naga runs off in the distance; kneeling and pointing at the escapees.] The Avatar. That's her!,3,1,3
,"Several Equalists immediately run after them. The shot moves up, revealing Amon standing on the balcony, overlooking the situation, his hands folded casually behind his back.",3,1,3
Amon,Let her go. [The Equalist fighters stop; frontal shot as he puts his hands on the balcony railing.] She's the perfect messenger to tell the city of my power.,3,1,3

Tenzin,"Thank goodness. [Side shot; Korra stops.] I was just about to send out a search party. [Putting his hands on her shoulders.] Are you all right? [Korra turns away from him and shakes her head, grabbing her arms. Frontal shot; concerned.] Korra, what happened? Did you find your friend?",3,1,3
Korra,"[Quietly.] Yes, but ... [Stronger voiced.] I was at an Equalist rally. [Turns to Tenzin.] I saw Amon.",3,1,3
Tenzin,[Close-up; shocked.] What?,3,1,3
Korra,[Frontal shot.] He can take people's bending away. [Alarmed.] For good.,3,1,3
Tenzin,[Frontal shot.] That's ... [Briefly looks away.] that's impossible. Only the Avatar has ever possessed that ability.,3,1,3
Korra,[Frontal shot; begging to be believed.] But I saw him do it.,3,1,3
Tenzin,"[Frontal shot; calmly.] I believe you. [Turning to his right.] I don't know how Amon has achieved this power, but this means the revolution is more dangerous than ever. [Back-shot of a turned Korra and Tenzin who look out at Republic City. The shot slowly pans up to show and zoom in on a lit Republic City.] No bender is safe.",3,1,3
,Fade to credits.,3,1,3
,"The episode opens up at night in Korra's room with her sleeping. As a shadow passes the doors, she quickly shoots up in her bed, alarmed. Soon after, an Equalist chi blocker breaks through the window, while two more break in through the door. Korra jumps out of her bed and kicks a downward fire arc through the air. She kicks another arc in the air toward them. The chi blockers dodge it and come at her, but Korra blasts two shots of fire to keep them at bay. The chi blockers avoid her attacks, while one leaps up in the air while spinning like a top in an attempt to kick Korra's head, but Korra blocks the hit with her arm, and fires several fists of fire. While Korra is distracted from keeping two of the chi blockers away, the other somersaults and uses chi blocking on her back, before kicking her to the ground on her knees while she lets out a shout of pain. Fatigued, Korra sees Amon walking toward her as she hears footsteps.",4,1,4
Amon,"After I take your bending away, you will be nothing. [Reaches hand toward Korra's face as she watches with fear.]",4,1,4

Korra,"It's ... it's all right, Naga. I just had a bad dream. [Korra rests her head in her arms on top of Naga's head, petting her.]",4,1,4
,"The camera flashes toward City Hall where the United Republic Council meets. Inside the representatives are sitting around a ""U"" shaped table sharing in discussion.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"There is a madman running around our beloved city, threatening to tear it apart. We need to create a task force whose sole mission is to find Amon and bring him to justice.",4,1,4
Tenzin,[Opposing.] Absolutely not. A move that aggressive would only further divide benders and nonbenders.,4,1,4
Fire Nation councilwoman,"Tarrlok, I'm inclined to agree with your proposal, but who would even [Slightly skeptical.] head up such a task force?",4,1,4
Tarrlok,[Stands up and bows.] It would be my honor and privilege to accept such a duty.,4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Accusingly.] This is just another one of your ploys to gain more power, isn't it? [Pounds the table lightly.]",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, forty-two years ago, Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man. Yakone. [Points a finger at Tenzin.] Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head-on.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"This.. is a completely different situation ... [Stands up as well, and angrily points his finger at Tarrlok.] and how dare you compare yourself to Avatar Aang!",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Close-up of Tarrlok's serious face.] Amon is not going to stop with the bending triads. [He turns to look at the other three representatives as the scene cuts to them as they glance at each other.] Eventually, he will come for all us benders. Our friends, our families. Vote for this task force and I will stop Amon before it's too late. All in favor?",4,1,4
,"Tarrlok raises his hand and the Fire Nation representative raises her hand as well. After a brief glance at each other, the Southern Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom representatives also raise their hands. With that, Tarrlok slams a gavel down on a platform to close the meeting and smiles mischievously at Tenzin while he glares at him. Cuts to later during nighttime, at Air Temple Island, light, happy music plays as Korra practices airbending stances. The music becomes static and soon after, Amon's voice is heard.",4,1,4
Amon,"Good evening, my fellow Equalists. [Cut to Korra as she stops her practicing and sharply looks at the radio as she hears Amon.] This is your leader, Amon. [Cut to her as she slowly turns to look at the radio with fear on her face.] As you have heard, the Republic Council has voted to make me public enemy number one, proving once again that the bending [Close-up of Korra's frightened face.] oppressors of this city will stop at nothing to quash our revolution. But we cannot be stopped. Our numbers grow stronger by the day. You no longer have to live in fear. [Close-up of Korra's eyes as sweat drips down her face.] The time has come for benders to experience fear. [The radio returns to static.]",4,1,4
,"Later, Mako is walking in a more industrialized part of Republic City. He throws one end of his scarf over his shoulder and looks up in the direction of a trolley which is being boarded. He runs toward the trolley, crossing the street without looking. Meanwhile, a moped is driving down the street. The rider of the moped, Asami, sees Mako and quickly tries to stop, though she still crashes into Mako while he screams and tumbles over. She wheels the moped over to Mako, while he picks himself up off the street.",4,1,4
Asami,"Oh, no! [Runs toward Mako.] I'm so sorry. I didn't see you. [Takes off her helmet.]",4,1,4
Mako,"[Gets into a sitting position and rubs the back of his head; somewhat angrily.] How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juu ... [Glances at Asami, while she is throwing her hair back.] uh, I was ... I- I ... wow. [Coughs.] I was ... [Clears throat and blushes.]",4,1,4
Asami,"[Clutches Mako's arm.] Are you okay? Did I hurt you? Ugh, I'm such an idiot. [Helps Mako to his feet.]",4,1,4
Mako,"Don't worry, I'm fine. My brother hits me harder than that every day in practice. [Brushes himself off.]",4,1,4
Asami,"Wait, I recognize you. You're Mako, right? You play for the Fire Ferrets.",4,1,4
Mako,"Yeah, that's me.",4,1,4
Asami,"[Facepalms lightly.] I am so embarrassed. [Side-view as she reaches out hand to shake Mako's.] My name is Asami. Let me make this up to you somehow. Uh, how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, eight o' clock, Kwong's Cuisine. [Returns to her moped.]",4,1,4
Mako,"Uh, Kwong's? I don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy.",4,1,4
Asami,[Puts her helmet back on.] I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up. [Puts goggles on.] So ... it's a date?,4,1,4
Mako,"Uh, yeah, I guess so. I'll see you tomorrow night.",4,1,4
,"Asami gets back on her moped and drives away taking one brief glance behind her. Mako watches her ride away and grins widely, lovestruck. Later, at sunset on Air Temple Island, Tenzin's family and Korra are about to eat dinner. Before eating, they bow their heads as Tenzin starts a prayer.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"We are grateful for this delicious food, for happiness, for compassion, and ...",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[The camera pans to the left to show him standing in the doorhole.] I'm not interrupting, am I? [Bowing.]",4,1,4
Tenzin,"This is my home, Tarrlok. We're about to eat dinner. [Turns and stands up to face Tarrlok.]",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"Good, because I am absolutely famished. [Tenzin narrows his eyes while glaring at him.] Airbenders never turn away a hungry guest, am I right?",4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Sighs.] I suppose. [Takes a seat and glances at his wife, Pema, who scowls at him. He raises his hands, palms facing forward while shrugging, giving her a helpless look.]",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Walks over to Korra.] Ah, you must be the famous Avatar Korra. It is truly an honor. [Bows.] I am Councilman Tarrlok, representative from the Northern Water Tribe.",4,1,4
Korra,"[Stands up and bows, with Tarrlok bowing as well in acknowledgment.] Nice to meet you. [They both kneel in a sitting position.]",4,1,4
Ikki,[Leans over the table toward Tarrlok.] Why do you have three ponytails? [Sniffs the air.] And how come you smell like a lady? You're weird.,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"Well aren't you ... precocious? [He directs his attention to Korra, although Ikki continues glaring at him.] So, I've been reading all about your adventures in the papers. Infiltrating Amon's rally, now that took some real initiative.",4,1,4
Korra,"Oh, thanks. I think you're the first authority figure in the city who's happy I'm here.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,Republic City is much better off now that you've arrived.,4,1,4
Tenzin,"[In a protective tone.] Enough with the flattery, Tarrlok. What do you want from Korra?",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Holds up his hand.] Patience, Tenzin. I'm getting to that. [He directs his attention to Korra while Tenzin glares at him.] As you may have heard, I am assembling a task force that will strike at the heart of the revolution and I want you to join me.",4,1,4
Korra,[Surprised.] Really?,4,1,4
Tenzin,[Leans forward; surprised.] What?!,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"I need someone who will help me attack Amon directly, someone who is fearless in the face of danger. [Gestures to Korra.] And that someone is you.",4,1,4
Korra,"Join your task force? I can't. [As surprise lights Tenzin and Tarrlok's faces, Korra takes a sip of her drink.]",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Surprised.] I must admit, I'm rather surprised. I thought you'd jump at the chance to help me lead the charge against Amon.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Somewhat quietly.] Me, too.",4,1,4
Korra,"I came to Republic City to finish my Avatar training with Tenzin. Right now, I just need to focus on that.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,Which is why this opportunity is perfect. You would get on the job experience while performing your Avatar duty for the city.,4,1,4
Tenzin,[Somewhat annoyed.] Korra gave you her answer. It's time for you to go.,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"Very well. [Stands up to leave.] But, [Chuckles slightly.] I'm not giving up on you just yet. [Waggles finger at her.] You'll be hearing from me soon. [Bows.] It has been a pleasure, Avatar Korra. [Begins to walk out of the room.]",4,1,4
Ikki,"[Stands up and waves.] Bye-bye, ponytail man!",4,1,4
,"Councilman Tarrlok scowls at Ikki's farewell and grunts in distaste as he walks out. Meanwhile, Mako is at Kwong's Cuisine, staring in awe. He clutches his scarf and checks his sleeves. He sighs at his results and walks in.",4,1,4
Server,"Ah, welcome to Kwong's Cuisine, Master Mako. [Bows.]",4,1,4
Mako,"Uh, ""Master""?",4,1,4
,"In a back room, the server who greeted Mako as he walked in unfolds a shirt from a box and dresses it on Mako. The server pulls up Mako's pants, ties his shoes, styles his hair, and gives him a formal-looking jacket to wear. Mako examines the clothes with pleasure. He grabs his red scarf from the table behind him and puts it around his neck. The server glances at it and starts to pull it off, when Mako prevents him from doing so by catching the server's wrist.",4,1,4
Mako,The scarf stays.,4,1,4
Server,"As you wish, sir. [Bows.] This way please. [Holds his arm to the side and leads Mako back into the restaurant area.]",4,1,4
Asami,[Sitting next to Mako as he takes a drink.] I am such a big pro-bending fan. I caught all of your matches this season.,4,1,4
Mako,"All of them? Wow. Honestly, I wish there were a few you hadn't seen.",4,1,4
Asami,"Oh, don't be ridiculous, you're amazing. I can't wait to see you play in the tournament.",4,1,4
Mako,"Yeah, well, ah, maybe next year.",4,1,4
Asami,What do you mean? You made it in.,4,1,4
Mako,It just isn't in the cards for us right now.,4,1,4
Asami,[Puts her hand on top of Mako's on the table.] Tell me. [Close-up of Asami's face.] What's the problem?,4,1,4
Mako,"We don't have the cash to ante up for the championship pot. So, it looks like we're out of the running.",4,1,4
Asami,That's not fair.,4,1,4
Server,"[Carries two silver colored plates with dome lids.] Pardon me, Ms. Sato. [Lifts up the lids; Mako's eyes widen with shock.] Your main course.",4,1,4
Mako,"Ms. Sato? You wouldn't happen to be related to Hiroshi Sato, creator of the Satomobile?",4,1,4
Asami,Yeah. He's my dad.,4,1,4
Mako,[Surprised.] Get out of town!,4,1,4
Asami,I'm serious. [Picks up cup and takes a sip of her drink.] You want to meet him?,4,1,4
Mako,"Meet the most successful captain of industry in all of Republic City? Yeah, I'll take you up on that.",4,1,4
,"Back on Air Temple Island, Bolin comes singing a light tune with Pabu on his shoulder.",4,1,4
Bolin,"[Cheerfully.] Hello, fellow teammate!",4,1,4
Korra,"Hey, Bolin. [Rubs Naga's chest.]",4,1,4
Bolin,Missed you at practice this week.,4,1,4
Korra,"Yeah, sorry about that.",4,1,4
Bolin,"Nah, that's all right. We're probably out of the tournament anyways unless some money miraculously drops out of the sky by tomorrow. Anyways, the reason I came by was to give you this. [Holds out a cupcake and a rose. Pabu climbs off his shoulder.] Ta-da!",4,1,4
Korra,"Wow, thanks. [Takes Bolin's gifts.] What's this for?",4,1,4
Bolin,"[Rubbing his chin.] Uh, oh I can't remember now. Oh yeah, now I remember. You saved me from Amon!",4,1,4
Korra,"Oh, that? [Shrugs.] It was no big deal.",4,1,4
Bolin,"No big deal, are you serious? I was totally freaking out when he was coming at me with his creepy mask all, ""I will take away your bending forever."" [Acts like a zombie trying to comically replicate Amon while Korra looks at him with a worried expression.] I mean that is.. scary stuff; I still can't sleep well.",4,1,4
Korra,Mhmm.,4,1,4
Council page,Delivery for Avatar Korra. [Carries in a large basket of items surrounded by flowers and sets them next to Korra.] Tarrlok sends his compliments and urges you to reconsider his offer.,4,1,4
Korra,Tell him I haven't changed my mind.,4,1,4
Council page,Mhmm ... [Bows and walks off.],4,1,4
Bolin,"Who's this Tarrlok guy? Is he bothering you? Huh, 'cause I could have a word with him. [Punches fist into his other hand.]",4,1,4
Korra,"[Somewhat amused.] Heh, no it's not like that. He's just some old guy who works with Tenzin on the council.",4,1,4
Bolin,"Oh, good. Good, that sounds better. I like that better.",4,1,4
,"The scene switches to a Satomobile being lifted so workers can examine it in a factory. The factory contains several rows of Satomobiles in an assembly line. Hiroshi Sato and his daughter, Asami Sato, stand side by side, while Mako stands in front of them for conversation purposes.",4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,What do you think of my little operation here?,4,1,4
Mako,"It's very impressive, Mr. Sato.",4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,"Please, call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.",4,1,4
Mako,"Uh, well ...",4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,"Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age, I was a mere shoe-shiner, and all I had to my name was an idea; the Satomobile. [Briefly cuts to a Satomobile.] Now, I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea off the ground and I built the entire Future Industries empire from that one selfless loan. [Raises his hands toward the assembly lines.]",4,1,4
Asami,"Dad, stop bragging. Just tell Mako the good news. [Her dad chuckles.]",4,1,4
Mako,What good news?,4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,"Well, my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in the Pro-bending Arena. And about your team's current [Puts his hand on Mako's shoulder.] financial stumbling block. Now, I'd hate to see you lose your chance at winning the championship just because you're short a few yuans. That's why I'm going to sponsor the Fire Ferrets in the tournament.",4,1,4
Mako,Are you serious?,4,1,4
Asami,He's serious. My dad's going to cover your ante for the championship pot.,4,1,4
Mako,Tha-that is good news.,4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,There's just one catch. You all have to wear the Future Industries logo on your uniforms.,4,1,4
Mako,"I'll tattoo it on my chest if you want, sir. [Points to his chest and smiles while both Hiroshi and Asami chuckle.] Thank you both so much. [Shakes Hiroshi and Asami's hands.] I promise the Fire Ferrets will make the most of this opportunity.",4,1,4
,"Back on Air Temple Island, Tenzin walks past a luxurious Satomobile wrapped in a ribbon with Ikki and Meelo playing inside.",4,1,4
Ikki,"[Making car noises.] Out of the way Daddy, we're driving here! [Tenzin shakes his head at the gift.] Beeeeeeep beebeebeeeeep!",4,1,4
Meelo,Beep-beep.,4,1,4
,Tenzin walks on to where Korra is practicing airbending stances on a round platform with a Yin-Yang symbol.,4,1,4
Tenzin,I see Tarrlok's gifts are getting more and more extravagant.,4,1,4
Korra,"[Sighs.] Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to take ""no"" for an answer.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"Korra, are you ... doing all right?",4,1,4
Korra,"Yeah, I'm fine. [Pauses her training.]",4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Takes a seat on the stairs leading to the training platform and points to the spot next to him.] Why don't you take a break? [Korra walks toward Tenzin and takes a seat.] I'm glad you turned down Tarrlok, but I just want to make sure your decision was for the right reason.",4,1,4
Korra,I'm just really focused on my airbending right now is all.,4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Muses over her answer.] Right, that's what you said. You know, it's okay to be scared. The whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears, because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance.",4,1,4
,"Korra looks away with a slightly sad face, visibly hit by the impact of Tenzin's words. Tenzin stands up.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"I'm always here for you, if you want to talk.",4,1,4
,"Tenzin walks away, the scene shifts to show a saddened Korra leaning against the door of the mansion on Air Temple Island.",4,1,4
Council page,Avatar Korra! I have something for you.,4,1,4
,"Annoyed, Korra jumps down from the railing she was sitting on, and earthbends the page around 180 degrees, and sends him off by kicking him in the back.",4,1,4
Korra,"It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I am no​t joining his task force.",4,1,4
,"In the background, Ikki and Jinora are seen playing a game of Pai Sho. They look up from their game to see what is happening.",4,1,4
Council page,"It's not a gift, it's an invitation.",4,1,4
Korra,[Surprised.] To what? [Gives an angry look to the page and grabs the papers out of his hands and starts reading them.],4,1,4
Council page,Tarrlok is throwing a gala in your honor. [Bows lightly.] All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The councilman humbly requests your attendance.,4,1,4
,"Korra frowns at the paper, music kicks in as the scene now scrolls down from the night sky to show the City Hall with two huge banners with the picture of Korra on them. Shortly after, Korra, Tenzin, Pema, Ikki, Jinora, and Meelo enter the City Hall building dressed in gala clothing. The kids run off. The other attendants start clapping as they notice Korra walking in. Pema starts wandering off and socializing with the people in the background. Korra looks around stunned, standing next to Tenzin.",4,1,4
Korra,I can't believe this is all for me.,4,1,4
Tenzin,"I'm not sure what Tarrlok's plotting, but keep your guard up. It's not like him to throw a party just for the fun of it.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Walks toward Korra and Tenzin making overdone gestures.] So glad you could make it, Avatar Korra. [Meelo runs behind Korra and Tenzin. Addresses Tenzin.] If you'd excuse us, the city awaits its hero. [Walks off with Korra.]",4,1,4
,Tenzin starts looking around and notices Meelo. His head turns blue in surprise and he gasps.,4,1,4
Tenzin,"Meelo! No, that's not a toilet! Oh dear. [Walks toward Meelo in shame while covering his eyes. The scene shifts to Korra and Tarrlok.]",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"Korra, it's my pleasure to introduce Republic City's most famous industrialist, Hiroshi Sato.",4,1,4
Korra,Nice to meet you.,4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,[Bows.] We're all expecting great things from you.,4,1,4
Korra,"Right, [Looks down sadly.] greatness.",4,1,4
Mako,"[Walks toward Korra with Bolin next to him and Asami Sato holding his arm. Korra frowns and narrows her eyes when she notices this.] Hey, Korra!",4,1,4
Hiroshi Sato,"[Gestures to Asami.] This is my daughter, Asami.",4,1,4
Asami,It's lovely to meet you. Mako's told me so much about you.,4,1,4
Korra,[In a clipped tone.] Really? Because he hasn't mentioned you at all. How did you two meet?,4,1,4
Bolin,[Leans over toward Korra and talks quickly.] Asami crashed into him on her moped.,4,1,4
Korra,[Slightly concerned.] What? Are you okay?,4,1,4
Mako,I'm fine. More than fine. Mister Sato agreed to sponsor our team; we're back in the tournament!,4,1,4
Bolin,"[Excitedly.] Hehe, isn't that great?",4,1,4
Korra,"[In a unexcited tone.] Yeah, terrific.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[To Lin Beifong walking by.] Chief Beifong, I believe you and Avatar Korra have already met.",4,1,4
Lin Beifong,"[To Korra in a harsh tone while glaring at her.] Just because the city's throwing you this big to-do, [Leans in slightly.] don't think you're something special. [The camera zooms out as both Korra and Lin glare at each other.] You've done absolutely nothing to deserve this. [Walks away.]",4,1,4
,"Korra glares at Lin as she leaves, though her look saddens as Lin Beifong walks away. Tarrlok and Korra are now seen walking toward a stair, where a lot of reporters are waiting downstairs. Many guests are present in the background. As soon as the media notices Korra, they rush for the stairs and start bombarding her with questions.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"If you'd be so kind, they just have a couple of questions.",4,1,4
Korra,But ...,4,1,4
,Tarrlok pushes her forward.,4,1,4
Reporter #1,"Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take away people's bending firsthand. How serious a threat does he pose to the innocent citizens of Republic City?",4,1,4
Korra,[Clears throat.] I think he presents a real problem. [She sounds slightly confused while saying this.],4,1,4
,"Tarrlok is seen in the background smiling, as his plan to force Korra into his task force seems to be working.",4,1,4
Reporter #2,"Then why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force? As the Avatar, shouldn't you be going after Amon?",4,1,4
Korra,"Well, I ...",4,1,4
Reporter #2,Why are you backing away from this fight?,4,1,4
Korra,[Offended.] What? No! I've never backed away from anything in my life!,4,1,4
Reporter #3,"You promised to serve this city, aren't you going back on that promise now?",4,1,4
Reporter #4,Do you think pro-bending is more important than fighting the revolution?,4,1,4
Reporter #5,How do you think Avatar Aang would have handled this?,4,1,4
,"Korra is clearly starting to get confused, annoyed, and intimidated by this bombardment of questions.",4,1,4
Reporter #2,[Cuts to a close-up of Korra's face; voice-over.] Are you afraid of Amon?,4,1,4
Korra,[Yells.] I am not afraid of anybody! If the city needs me then ... [Gestures to Tarrlok.] I'll join Tarrlok's task force and help fight Amon.,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"[Rushes forward to put his arm on Korra's shoulder and yells.] There's your headline, folks.",4,1,4
,"As cameras start flashing, Tenzin looks down in disappointment and being powerless. Bolin and Mako look at each other, confused. The other guests in the scene also look confused except Asami, who is still smiling and looking forward while holding Mako's arm. Tarrlok smiles mischievously as Korra looks down with a sad expression when she realizes that she has been tricked. Scene changes to show the outside of the City Hall. Shifts to Korra, who is twiddling her thumbs and looking sad.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"My fellow task force deputies, tonight we will execute a raid on an underground chi blocker training camp located in the Dragon Flats borough. According to my sources, there is a cellar underneath this bookstore, [Points at a blueprint of a bookstore.] where Equalists train chi blocking in secret.",4,1,4
,"Camera fades from the blueprints to a view of the bookstore from above while a large car with a water tank and filled with task force members in a kneeling position drives toward its location. Once stopped, the task force members jump out and up against the wall. Korra peers through an opening at the bottom of the wall and sees several men and woman training and learning chi blocking techniques. On the opposite wall lays a large poster with a portrait of Amon staring over the room. Korra has a flashback to her dream at the beginning of the episode where Amon is reaching toward her. Korra gasps with fear, but puts a resolved look on her face. She stands up and looks at Tarrlok for the signal. Tarrlok nods and raises his hand to show his fingers outstretched. He closes them into a fist, shows his outstretched palm again, closes his hand into a fist again, and flashes two fingers this time. A task force member unwinds the top of the water tank and bends the water out. Another member bends the water toward him and to another task force member and another until all the waterbenders have water at their disposal. Two members of the task force are shown with water ready for the signal to attack. The camera flashes to Tarrlok holding his hand out behind him, where a waterbender is holding the water waiting for a signal. Korra breathes in and out and the scene changes to inside the room of chi blocker trainers and trainees. Water floods the room and freezes, with the people inside yelping in surprise. The task force earthbenders break through the wall, causing several chi blockers and trainees to leap back. Three task force earthbenders attack the people by throwing bricks. One earthbender pushes up a block of earth and slams it into a person slamming them into a wall. Tarrlok and Korra enter the room. Tarrlok throws someone against the wall using waterbending and freezes their head to the wall. A chi blocker throws two grenades that have green gas filtering out of them, while another opens the door and escapes. Korra freezes the two grenades in ice and the leaking smoke clears up.",4,1,4
Korra,I'm going after those two.,4,1,4
,"Korra kicks open the door the two chi blockers left through and runs down the corridor. She trips over a wire and crashes to the ground. A chi blocker leaps out from a space in the ceiling and tries to grab Korra. Korra quickly gets up and kicks a large rock up from underneath the chi blocker, hitting him in the chest. She falls back from the left over momentum, but another chi blocker comes from behind her swinging a bola. Tarrlok blasts a stream of water at the chi blocker and freezes him to the wall.",4,1,4
Korra,"Nice timing. Thanks, Tarrlok.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"We make a good team, Avatar.",4,1,4
Korra,"Yeah, we do. [Crosses her arms and gives him a demeaning look.]",4,1,4
,"The scene switches to a group of reporters, flashing cameras, and the people who participated in the task force standing over several captured chi blockers. After another flash from a camera, Tarrlok is seen ushering a chi blocker into the back of a police truck with several task force members on the side. Another flash reveals a row of task force members with Korra at the front with an annoyed look, Tarrlok answering a reporter's question through a microphone, the chi blockers in the middle, and another row of task force members on the other side. The picture turns black and white and is zoomed out to show the same picture in a newspaper. Toza is sweeping his gym, while Bolin makes two plates of earth hover above his hands using earthbending and Mako is reading the newspaper.",4,1,4
Bolin,No Korra for practice again?,4,1,4
Mako,[With a grim expression.] Doesn't look like it.,4,1,4
,"Bolin slumps and sighs, throwing the two plates of earth at the wall. The scene switches to a room full of reporter with Tarrlok on stage behind a podium and Korra at his side.",4,1,4
Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra has bravely answered the call to action. With the two of us leading the charge, Republic City has nothing to fear from Amon and the Equalists.",4,1,4
Female reporter,Question for the Avatar! [Stands up.] Amon remains at large. Why have you failed to locate him?,4,1,4
Korra,"[Comes closer to the microphone, while Tarrlok takes a step back.] You want to know why? Because Amon is hiding in the shadows like a coward. [Grabs microphone.] Amon, I challenge you to a duel! No task force, no chi blockers, just the two of us tonight at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island. Let's cut to the chase and settle this thing, if you're man enough to face me. [Puts the microphone down and walks off stage, as the reporters buzz with questions asking for details and standing up to get attention.]",4,1,4
,The scene changes to the park where Mako and Asami are riding inside a carriage.,4,1,4
Asami,"I know it sounds weird to say this, but I'm really glad I hit you with my moped.",4,1,4
Mako,"[Chuckles.] Uh, me too.",4,1,4
Asami,I forgot to ask. Why didn't you accept the new silk scarf I bought for you last week? You didn't like it?,4,1,4
Mako,"No, it was really nice, but this scarf was my father's. And it's all I have left of him. I just feel like ... [Shrugs.] Like it keeps me safe.",4,1,4
Asami,I'm so sorry. I lost my mother when I was very young. [Looks up when Mako grabs her hand.],4,1,4
,"Mako and Asami stare at each other warmly, and she cuddles into Mako's side putting her hand on his chest, while Mako reaches up to hold it there.",4,1,4
Asami,I feel so safe with you. [Squeezes Mako's hand.],4,1,4
,"The trolley rides off into the park with the two inside passing two other couples. The scene changes to a bird's eye view of the Republic City dock. Tenzin passes the camera on his glider and lands on the dock where Korra, Tarrlok, and several others are.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"Korra, this is madness.",4,1,4
Korra,[Wraps rope loosely around her arms and hands.] Don't try to stop me and don't follow me. I have to face Amon alone.,4,1,4
Tenzin,[Addresses Tarrlok angrily.] This is all your doing!,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"I tried to talk her out of it too, but she's made up her mind.",4,1,4
,Korra guides the boat out from the docks to Avatar Aang Memorial Island using waterbending.,4,1,4
Tarrlok,"We'll be watching the island closely. If anything goes wrong, I have a fleet of police airships ready to swoop down.",4,1,4
,"The camera glides down Avatar Aang's statue and at the base stands Korra with her hair being blown by the wind. The camera changes viewpoints to capture the front of the memorial building and Korra standing on top of it. At slight provocation, Korra gets into a battle stance. As the clock sounds midnight, Korra startles. The camera alternates viewpoints to show the skyline at night, most of the buildings still seem to be lit. Cut back to the statue again, eventually scrolling down toward Korra, while she sighs in relief as soon as she realized it was just the clock that startled her. Korra takes a deep breath to recover her focus and stares at the skyline as the lights start to dim she sits down, tired and exhausted from waiting in fear.",4,1,4
Korra,"[Yawns and talks to herself.] Guess you're a no-show, Amon. Who's scared now? [Stands up and walks away while stretching.]",4,1,4
,"As Korra walks past the base of the statue, a bola is thrown at her feet and Korra is dragged into the base of the statue. As soon as she reaches the center, she finds herself surrounded by a circle of twenty-one chi blockers. She quickly spins and bends fire around her in an attempt to defend herself, but she is quickly overwhelmed as two whips entangle her hands from both sides, preventing her to move away, she uses her legs to kick some fire and earth around, but she is ultimately hit in the back by several punches from multiple chi blockers. The scene fades to black. Korra lies down on the ground with several chi blockers behind her. Two Equalists take her by the arms and force her to sit on her knees. She looks up and notices Amon entering the area.",4,1,4
Amon,"I received your invitation, young Avatar.",4,1,4
,Korra is frightened as Amon reaches out his hand in order to touch her face; she turns her face away. Amon bends his wrist so his hand is now with his palm facing upward as he grabs Korra by her chin and forces her to look at him. Korra looks at him full of fear.,4,1,4
Amon,"Our showdown, while inevitable, is premature. Although it would be the simplest thing for me to take away your bending right now, I won't. You'd only become a martyr. [Korra looks at him with anger.] Benders of every nation would rally behind your untimely demise, [Her expression changes back to fear.] but I assure you, I have a plan. And I'm saving you for last, then you'll get your duel, and I will destroy you.",4,1,4
,"Korra faints as Amon jabs Korra on her shoulder. During her unconsciousness, she sees a vision of Sokka, Toph, Aang, and Yakone. The people in the vision all seem about the right age to be living in 128 AG. Aang charges toward the camera, ready to attack. Korra regains consciousness, as she sees a shady figure in an airbender's tunic running toward her.",4,1,4
Korra,[Weakly.] Aang?,4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Yells.] Korra! [Grabs her by the shoulders and sits her up.] Korra, are you all right? What happened? Was Amon here?",4,1,4
Korra,"Yeah, he ambushed me.",4,1,4
Tenzin,[Worried.] Did he ... did he take your bending away?,4,1,4
Korra,"[Creates a flame in the palm of her right hand, before closing it again.] No, I'm okay.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Relieved.] Ah, thank goodness.",4,1,4
,Korra suddenly starts crying and embraces Tenzin and continues crying on his chest. Tenzin comforts Korra by putting his arms around her.,4,1,4
Korra,"[Still crying.] I was so terrified, I felt so helpless.",4,1,4
Tenzin,"[Gently.] It's all right, the nightmare is over.",4,1,4
Korra,"[Backs away a little, yet still crying.] You ... you were right ... I've been scared this whole time. [Wipes tears away.] I've never felt like this before and ... and Tenzin, I don't know what to do! [Takes cover in Tenzin's chest again.]",4,1,4
Tenzin,[Gently.] Admitting your fears is the first and most difficult step in overcoming them.,4,1,4
,The camera pans up. Fade to credits.,4,1,4
,"The episode opens up to show a slowly zooming in aerial shot of the the Pro-bending Arena as it snows. Cut to a frontal, close-up shot of a determined looking Korra handling a water blob. The camera moves back as she splits it in two, and rapidly launches each smaller water bullet in a different direction. Cut to a side-shot of Bolin, who raises his right arm in front of him, an earth disk following the motion and hovering in front of his face. As the water blob Korra launched at him strikes the disk, he is shoved slightly backward by the impact. Cut to a frontal shot of Mako, who moves back and twists around, vaporizing the incoming blob with a fire arc. He immediately retaliates with two fire punches. Cut to an overview shot of the entire gym and the practicing Fire Ferrets. Bolin's earth disk is pulverized by Mako's fire attack. Korra aims another rapid water blast at Mako, who jumps over it, while Bolin launches an earth disk at Korra, forcing her to shield herself with water from a nearby tank. Mako fires a blast at each of his team mates, which both of them block with their respective element. A second fire blast hits Bolin square in the stomach. Cut to a frontal shot as he is flung backward. As he is falling down, he raises and launches a last earth disk. Cut to Korra who directs a water blob away from her, but is knocked back with a grunt as the earth disk plants itself in her stomach. Cut to Mako as Korra's water attack hits him straight in the face, flinging him to the ground several meters from where he was standing. Switch back to the overview shot of the gym as they all sit up and laugh. Cut to a frontal shot of Mako as he stands up and takes off his helmet, resting his left hand on his hip.",5,1,5
Mako,"[Smiling.] It's been great having you at so many back-to-back practices, Korra.",5,1,5
Korra,"[Upbeat.] Feels good to be back, although [Slightly raises her hand to emphasize her statement; smiling.] Tarrlok isn't too happy about my leave of absence.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Hey, you joined the Fire Ferrets before you joined his task force.",5,1,5
Mako,"Okay, come on, team huddle time!",5,1,5
,"The team huddles up, smiling at each other.",5,1,5
Mako,"It's our first match of the tournament tonight. I know the three of us haven't been a team for very long, but even so, the Fire Ferrets have never been this good. Are we ready?",5,1,5
Korra and Bolin,We're ready!,5,1,5
Asami,"[Walks in the practice room with the Future Industries sponsored gear.] Not quite, you'll need these. [Holds up a shirt with the Future Industries logo on it.]",5,1,5
Mako,"Hey, Asami.",5,1,5
Asami,"Good morning, sweetie.",5,1,5
,Korra looks annoyed.,5,1,5
Mako,These new uniforms look great!,5,1,5
Asami,"You look great, champ!",5,1,5
,"Mako and Asami do an 'Eskimo kiss'. Bolin looks with a ""Really?"" expression, while Korra shows her disgust, but quickly acts normal when Mako turns to her.",5,1,5
Mako,"Well, teammates, I'll see you before the match tonight. Asami and I have a lunch date.",5,1,5
Bolin,"[Waves at the couple.] Okay, we'll check you guys later, you know, we'll see you when we see ya.",5,1,5
,Korra picks up her bag in silence.,5,1,5
Bolin,"[Slides over to Korra with his hands behind his head.] So, Korra. There they go, here we are, all alone in the gym, just you and me, two alone people. Together. Alone.",5,1,5
Korra,"Ah, I gotta head back to the air temple to train with Tenzin. See ya!",5,1,5
,"Bolin looks disappointed about his failed attempt to pick a date with Korra. The scene cuts to the brothers' attic, where Mako is preparing dinner while Bolin is preparing a bath for Pabu. The animal protests his owner's act, but Bolin finally manages to dip Pabu into the tub of water, who subsequently rises from it, shaking off water from his body with a look of defeat.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Work with me here, Pabu! You wanna look spic and span in your new uniform, don't you? [To Mako.] So, what do you think of Korra, in a ""girlfriend"" sort of way?",5,1,5
Mako,She's great! But I think it makes more sense for me to go for Asami.,5,1,5
Bolin,[Slightly annoyed.] I was talking about a girlfriend for me! Leave some ladies for the rest of us!,5,1,5
Mako,"I know, that's what I thought you meant.",5,1,5
Bolin,Well ...?,5,1,5
Mako,"I don't know, Bo. It doesn't seem like a good idea for you to date Korra.",5,1,5
Bolin,You just said she was great two seconds ago.,5,1,5
Mako,"Yeah, Korra is a great athlete and the Avatar and stuff, but I don't know if she's really ""girlfriend material"". She's more like a pal.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Bro, you're nuts! Korra and I are perfect for each other: she's strong, I'm strong; she's fun, I'm fun; she's beautiful, I'm gorgeous! Okay, I don't care what you think, I'm gonna ask Korra out.",5,1,5
Mako,"Look, it just isn't smart to date a teammate, especially during the tournament. Keep your head out of the clouds and your priorities straight, okay?",5,1,5
Bolin,"Yeah, yeah, I know, gah. [To Pabu.] You know what I'm talking about, Pabu, I'm talking about real love. [Pabu looks confused.]",5,1,5
,"Cut to Air Temple Island. Korra, Jinora, and Ikki are feeding fruit to ring-tailed lemurs in the snow.",5,1,5
Jinora,"So, how's it going with the tall, dreamy firebender boy? You've been spending a lot of time together lately.",5,1,5
Ikki,"Oooh, yeah! Tell us all about the magical romance.",5,1,5
Korra,"What? [Laughs.] Listen to you two, I-I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff. [Coughs.] Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant, rich girl ... but let's just pretend for a second I am interested in him. What would I do?",5,1,5
Jinora,"Ooh! I just read a historical saga where the heroine fell in love with the enemy general's son, who's supposed to marry the princess. You should do what she did!",5,1,5
Korra,[Excited.] Tell me!,5,1,5
Jinora,She rode a dragon into battle and burned down the entire country. [Korra begins to frown at the unrealistic idea.] Then she jumped into a volcano. It was so romantic!,5,1,5
Korra,Uhh ...,5,1,5
Ikki,"No, no, no! [Speaking rapidly.] The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that makes true lovers sprout wings and fly into a magical castle in the sky, where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch. Forever and ever and ever! [Airbends upward in a circular motion out of excitement.]",5,1,5
Korra,The volcano is starting to make more sense to me now. [Pema laughs in the background.],5,1,5
Korra,"[Turns around and sees Pema on the path.] Oh, hey Pema. Uh, how long were you standing there?",5,1,5
Pema,"Long enough. But trust me, I know what you're going through. Years ago I was in the exact the same situation, with Tenzin.",5,1,5
Ikki,[Very surprised.] Daddy was in love with someone else before you?,5,1,5
Pema,That's right.,5,1,5
Korra,So what did you do?,5,1,5
Pema,"Well, for the longest time, I did nothing. I was so shy and scared of rejection, but watching my soul mate spend his life with the wrong woman became too painful. So I hung my chin out there and I confessed my love to Tenzin. And the rest is history.",5,1,5
"Korra, Ikki, and Jinora",Wooow!,5,1,5
,Cut to the Pro-bending Arena.,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"Folks, after a year of waiting the Pro-bending Championship is finally here. Tonight is the first set of matches in our single elimination sixteen team bracket. And I gotta tell ya, these are the most tenacious and talented bending trios this arena has ever seen.",5,1,5
Ring announcer,"Introducing our first team, the Future Industries Fire Ferrets! [Cheers by the crowd.] And their opponents, the Red Sands Rabaroos!",5,1,5
,The match between the Fire Ferrets and the Rabaroos starts.,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"What an explosive opening volley. Both teams quickly recover and unleash a barrage of bending. I am astonished with the level of improvement displayed here by the Fire Ferrets. No wonder the Avatar has been absent from the papers lately. She's obviously had her nose to the grindstone in the gym. The Ferrets advance into Rabaroo territory and are holding nothing back. Nice sprawl there by Mako. Bolin strikes, Ula dodges, and all three Rabaroos are down. The Fire Ferrets easily take round one!",5,1,5
Ring announcer,Round two!,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,The Rabaroos are looking for payback and they go straight after Bolin. Korra comes to his defense and water-whacks Umi back into zone two! The Ferrets are on fire tonight and they win round two.,5,1,5
Ring announcer,Round three!,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"With the Rabaroos down two rounds they'll need a knockout to win, and with the way the Fire Ferrets are playing I don't see that happening. These Ferrets are working together like a well-oiled bending machine. Bolin passes Adi back into zone two and the Ferrets get the green light to advance. The Rabaroos are just fighting to stay at their feet at this point. Out goes Adi, and Ula, and Umi!",5,1,5
Ring announcer,All three rounds go to the Future Industries Fire Ferrets to win the opening match of the tournament!,5,1,5
Bolin,"[The team cheers.] That's what I'm talking about! [To audience.] Thank you, thank you very much! Thank you all you fans!",5,1,5
Mako,"[Back in the changing area.] Wow, we were really connecting out there in that ring.",5,1,5
Korra,"Yeah! You know, I feel like the two of us have been connecting really well out of the ring, too.",5,1,5
Mako,"Uh, sure.",5,1,5
Korra,"So, I was thinking we should spend some time together.",5,1,5
Mako,"Oh, we've been spending lots of time together.",5,1,5
Korra,"I mean outside of the gym, and not while searching for kidnapped family members or fighting chi blockers.",5,1,5
Mako,I don't know. Asami and I have —,5,1,5
Korra,"[Abruptly.] Look, I really like you and I think we are meant for each other! [Korra quickly turns around and hides her face with her arm, blushing lightly.]",5,1,5
Mako,"[Gently.] Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you.",5,1,5
Korra,Forget I ever said anything ...,5,1,5
Asami,"[Walks into the room with Pabu on her shoulder.] Congratulations, guys! You were so amazing out there. [Kisses Mako on his cheek.]",5,1,5
,Mako and Korra look uncomfortably at each other. Korra takes a seat and Bolin takes a seat next to her.,5,1,5
Bolin,"So, Korra, I was thinking, you and me, we could get some dinner together, sort of a date situation.",5,1,5
Korra,"Oh, that's really sweet, but I don't think so. I don't feel very date-worthy.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Are you kidding me? You're the smartest, funniest, toughest, buffest, talentedest, incrediblest girl in the world!",5,1,5
Korra,[Chuckles.] You really feel that way about me?,5,1,5
Bolin,"I felt that way since the moment I saw you! Trust me, I know we're gonna have so much fun together.",5,1,5
Korra,"[Changing her mind.] You know what? I could use some fun. Okay, sure!",5,1,5
Bolin,"Yes! Who's the luckiest guy in the world? Right here, Bolin!",5,1,5
,"Mako watches while holding Asami, but Asami clings into him and rests her head on his shoulder. Mako still thinks about Korra and Bolin. Cut to Bolin and Korra eating in Narook's Seaweed Noodlery, Naga resting in front of the door.",5,1,5
Bolin,"[While slurping on noodles.] So, how do you like it?",5,1,5
Korra,"[With a mouthful of noodles too.] Hmm, it's delicious and totally authentic! I didn't realize how much I missed Water Tribe grub.",5,1,5
Bolin,"[Happily.] That's great, 'cause this is my favorite joint. See? You love Water Tribe food, I love Water Tribe food, just another reason we are so great together.",5,1,5
Korra,"[With noodles in her mouth.] They are good noodles! Hey, who's that creepy guy over there who keeps glaring at us?",5,1,5
,Camera flips to show Tahno at a table with a girl in each arm and some guys with him.,5,1,5
Bolin,"That's Tahno and the Wolfbats, the reigning champs, three years running. Don't make eye contact.",5,1,5
,"Korra disobeys and looks straight at him. Tahno walks up toward Korra and Bolin, along with his company.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Uh-oh, here he comes. Now don't mess with this guy, he's a nasty dude. [Eats noodles and is quite intimidated by Tahno.]",5,1,5
Tahno,"[Taunting.] Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Pro-bending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how did a couple of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament? Especially you, Uh-vatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons.",5,1,5
Korra,"[Stands up close in front of him, glaring.] You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, pretty boy?",5,1,5
Tahno,Go for it. I'll give you the first shot. [Smirks.],5,1,5
Bolin,"[Whispers.] Korra, don't. He's just trying to bait you. If you hit him, we're out of the tournament.",5,1,5
,"Korra whistles and Naga busts through the window, roaring loudly at Tahno. He falls over, but his friends behind him catch him and they walk away. Korra and Bolin laugh.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Whoa, ho, ho, I've never seen someone harass Tahno like that. You are one of a kind, Korra.",5,1,5
,"Korra and Bolin are drinking cocktails with straws. Bolin burps and is ashamed, but Korra notices this and burps even louder, to which Bolin burps again, louder this time, and Korra burps again yet even louder, and they both start laughing. The couple next to them looks on in horrified disgust. The scene now shows the Harmony Tower. The camera pans up from the bottom to the top of the tower and shows Korra and Bolin, along with many other couples, watching the city by night from the top of the tower. Korra really enjoys the view, and Bolin enjoys Korra having a good time. Cut to Mako sitting in front of the arena, sad. Korra walks up to him, he stands up.",5,1,5
Mako,[Slightly mad.] What kind of game are you playing?,5,1,5
Korra,[Confused.] Uh ... Pro-bending? We've got the quarterfinal match.,5,1,5
Mako,"No, I mean with Bolin. You've got him all in a tizzy and I know you're only using him to get back at me.",5,1,5
Korra,"I am not, we're just having fun together. What do you care, anyway?",5,1,5
Mako,[Defensive of Bolin.] I'm looking out for my little brother. I don't want to see his heart get broken.,5,1,5
Korra,"Wait a second ... you're not worried about him, you're jealous! You do have feelings for me!",5,1,5
Mako,What? Jealous? Don't be ridiculous.,5,1,5
Korra,Admit it! You like me.,5,1,5
Mako,"No, I'm with Asami.",5,1,5
Korra,"Yeah, but when you're with her you're thinking about me, aren't you?",5,1,5
Mako,[Angrily.] Get over yourself!,5,1,5
Korra,[Points to herself.] I'm just being honest.,5,1,5
Mako,You're crazy!,5,1,5
Korra,"You're a liar! [They both glare at each other, before storming away.]",5,1,5
Random stranger,"Hey Mako-! Oh ... [Mako ignores him, as he and Korra storm into the arena through different doors.]",5,1,5
,Cuts to the interior arena.,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"Eight teams have been eliminated and eight advance into the quarter finals, which get underway way tonight. The rookies are about to take on the former and longest-reigning champs, the Boar-q-pines. Youth clashes against experience in a battle for the ages, or rather of the ages. [Bell sounds, indicating the match starts.] Korra dodges and, ooh, slams right into her teammate! Down goes Mako and Bolin and Korra!",5,1,5
Ring announcer,Round one goes to the Boar-q-pines!,5,1,5
Mako,[To Korra.] You were supposed to defend while I attacked!,5,1,5
Korra,I had an opening so I took it!,5,1,5
Bolin,"What is up with you two? All right, whatever, just pull together, guys.",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"The Ferrets looking to mount some offense here in round two. Bolin lets fly a flurry of attacks, he's a one-man bending battalion. The Ferrets are having a rough time finding their rhythm tonight, but thanks to Bolin, they narrowly notch round two. Not sure what's eating them, but this is not the same team who took out the Rabaroos.",5,1,5
Ring announcer,Round three is a tie! We go to a tie-breaker to decide the match.,5,1,5
Referee,The Fire Ferrets win the coin toss! [To the Ferrets.] Which element do you choose?,5,1,5
Mako,I got this.,5,1,5
Bolin,"I know you usually handle these, but frankly, your head's not in the game. I'm gonna take this one. [Steps forward.] We choose earth.",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"[A platform in the middle of the stage raises with Bolin and Chang, the Boar-q-pine earthbender, on it.] Looks like the earthbenders will collide in the tie-breaker face-off. Bolin goes in for the grapple, Chang reverses. Bolin strikes from midair, knocking Chang to the edge of the circle. Another strike from Bolin, and Chang is in the drink!",5,1,5
Ring announcer,The Future Industries Fire Ferrets win their quarterfinal match! [Bolin cheers.],5,1,5
,"Korra and Mako are relieved that Bolin won the tie-breaker, but look away from each other angrily.",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"Oh, that was a close one folks! Youth trumps experience tonight.",5,1,5
,"Cut to Korra, staring from the balcony in sadness and anger, as Mako walks up to her.",5,1,5
Mako,"We need to talk. Look, sometimes you can be so infuriating. But I —",5,1,5
Korra,Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.,5,1,5
Mako,"No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is: as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing.",5,1,5
Korra,So you do like me?,5,1,5
Mako,"Yes, but, I like Asami, too. I don't know, things are complicated. I've been feeling really confused and —",5,1,5
,"Korra interrupts Mako by kissing him on the lips. It surprises him, but he kisses her back, making her blush. When they break the kiss, Korra immediately looks down in shame after having seen something behind Mako. Mako turns around to find Bolin standing there with flowers for Korra. He bursts into tears and runs away, dropping the flowers on the floor.",5,1,5
Mako,"Bolin, this isn't what you think! [To Korra, angrily.] Great, look at what you did!",5,1,5
Korra,[Insulted.] You're blaming me?,5,1,5
Mako,[Furiously.] You kissed me!,5,1,5
Korra,[Angrily.] You kissed me back!,5,1,5
,"Mako raises his fists and growls in frustration, before running after Bolin.",5,1,5
Korra,"[To herself, in a sad tone.] Well played, Korra.",5,1,5
,Cut to Mako walking into Narook's Seaweed Noodlery.,5,1,5
Mako,"Morning, Narook. My brother here? [Narook gestures.] Thanks. [Walks over to Bolin, slumped across a table.] Come on. Wake up. Taking you home, bro.",5,1,5
Bolin,"[Looks up and sniffs dejectedly.] Don't call me that. You're not my brother! You're a brother betrayer! [Sobs.] The only one I can trust anymore is Pabu! Pabu loves me. [Gestures at Pabu, who is lying in a bowl on the table with a big stomach.]",5,1,5
Mako,"You're a mess, and we've got the biggest match of our lives tonight. Let's go. [Puts a hand on Bolin's shoulder.]",5,1,5
Bolin,"[Slaps away Mako's hand.] No! I'm not going anywhere with you, you traitor! [Angrily points at Mako.]",5,1,5
Mako,Guess we'll have to do this the hard way. [Picks Bolin up and hauls him onto his back.],5,1,5
Bolin,[Sobbing.] Why?,5,1,5
Mako,Told you dating a teammate was a bad idea.,5,1,5
Bolin,You're a bad idea! Put me down! Put me down!,5,1,5
,"Pabu flops off the table and slowly follows. Cut to Pro-bending Arena at night, followed by Korra entering the locker room. She looks at Bolin sitting dejectedly on a bench, and walks silently past Mako. Cut to the Ferrets lining up against the Buzzard Wasps.",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"You can't find two teams more evenly matched in age, size, and strength than the Fire Ferrets and the Buzzard Wasps. Believe me, I've looked! This should be a pulse-pounding semifinal, folks! [Bell dings and play begins.] The Buzzard Wasps open with a flawlessly executed combo. All three Ferrets take an early visit to zone two. And Mako is knocked all the way back into zone three! The Fire Ferrets have been struggling to stay alive since the opening bell. All three players are totally out of sync tonight. [Bolin gets struck in the stomach with an earth disk.] Ooh, that has got to sting! [Bolin stumbles to the side of the ring, removes his helmet, throws it aside, and vomits.] And Bolin loses his noodles! Literally. [Korra turns around and watches with pity and disgust.] Which reminds me, this match is brought to you by our sponsor, Flameo Instant Noodles! Noodliest noodles in the United Republic. [Match continues and Korra is knocked into zone three.] The Buzzard Wasps fly deeper into Ferret territory. And Mako plunges into the pool! Can the Fire Ferrets hold on? The Wasps have the Ferrets backed up to the edge now ... and the Ferrets are bailed out by the bell! They had better pull themselves together for round two, otherwise they can kiss the finals goodbye.",5,1,5
,"Bell dings, second round begins. Mako gets knocked back a zone, and firebends a blast that hits Bolin in the back and knocks him to the ground.",5,1,5
Bolin,"[Turning to Mako.] Hey! Watch it! [As his back is turned, he is struck by a blast of water and knocked off the edge.]",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"The Wasps take advantage of Mako's unforced error and Bolin is in the pool! [Korra gets fancy with her waterbending and gets too carried away.] Ooh, and a blatant hold by the Avatar!",5,1,5
Referee,[Blows whistle.] Unnecessary roughness! Move back one zone!,5,1,5
Korra,"I'll unnecessarily rough you up! [Waterbends a blast at the referee as she heads back, and he grimly pulls out a yellow fan.]",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"And the Avatar is slapped with the yellow fan. The Ferrets are their own worst enemy right now. It's just sad to watch. With the Buzzard Wasps leading two rounds to zilch, the Ferrets' only hope of winning is with a knockout.",5,1,5
Mako,"Well, I guess there's always next year.",5,1,5
Korra,"Come on! We still have a chance, even if it is a slim one!",5,1,5
Bolin,"The way we're playing, we don't even deserve to be in the finals.",5,1,5
Korra,"Look, if we don't pull together and work as a team, we'll never forgive ourselves.",5,1,5
Mako,Let's just get this over with.,5,1,5
Bolin,"The sooner, the better.",5,1,5
,"The three grimly head back to the starting line and the bell dings, signaling the start of round three.",5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"Bolin's knocked into zone two, followed quickly by his brother! [An earth coin strikes Bolin in the shoulder and he cries out.] And Bolin takes a zinger to the shoulder! Looks like it's a clean hit.",5,1,5
Bolin,Owww!,5,1,5
Mako,Bolin! [Gets hit with a blast of fire and knocked off the edge.],5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"Mako's in the drink and out of the match. And Bolin keeps playing with one good arm! I gotta hand it to him, this kid's got grit! But how long can he keep it up? [Bolin gets knocked off the edge with an earth and water combo.] Apparently, not very long. The Ferrets' dream of making it to the finals now rests in the Avatar's hands. But with three on one, I don't like her odds. [Korra dodges the attacks in an attempt to stay in the ring.]",5,1,5
,"Cut to Bolin, pulling himself painfully out of the pool. He looks up as Mako kneels above him, smiling and offering a hand. Mako pulls Bolin up and steadies him.",5,1,5
Mako,Are you okay? How's your shoulder?,5,1,5
Bolin,"Ahh, it's messed up pretty bad. But I think I'll be all right. [Both boys step onto the lift, which begins rising.] Are we gonna be all right?",5,1,5
Mako,Of course we are. We're brothers. We'll get through this mess. I'm sorry.,5,1,5
Bolin,Me too! Girls ...,5,1,5
Mako,Seriously.,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"What an unbelievable effort here by Korra! She's dodging every element the Wasps throw at her! [Korra knocks each of the Wasps into a line.] The Avatar finally gains some ground, but with only ten seconds remaining, it might be too little too late! [Korra angles herself so that the Buzzard Wasps are lined up in front of her, and knocks them out with a single blast of water.] It's the big kibosh! What a knockout!",5,1,5
Bolin,[Excited.] Yes! She did it!,5,1,5
Mako,[Also excited.] Yes! Yeah!,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"It didn't seem possible, folks, but the Fire Ferrets are headed to the finals!",5,1,5
Bolin,"Ha, ha! [As Mako hugs him tightly in celebration.] Shoulder! Shoulder!",5,1,5
Mako,[Dropping him.] Sorry.,5,1,5
Bolin,"[As Korra walks up.] That, was pretty much the coolest thing I've ever seen.",5,1,5
Mako,Thanks for not giving up on us. We never would have made it this far without you. I owe you. Big time.,5,1,5
Korra,"You're welcome. So ... I know things are confusing right now, but I hope we can still be friends.",5,1,5
Mako,Definitely.,5,1,5
,Cut to the Wolfbats entering the locker room. Tahno enters last and inhales deeply with an expression of disgust.,5,1,5
Tahno,"[Disgusted.] Ooh, oof. You boys smell something in here? Wait, I know what that is; yeah, that's the scent of losers.",5,1,5
Korra,[The Fire Ferrets look at them with hate and disdain.] I hope we see you in the finals. Then we'll know who the losers really are.,5,1,5
Tahno,"[To Korra in a sarcastic tone.] Yeah, I'm peeing my pants over here.",5,1,5
Ring announcer,"And now, the defending champs, the White Falls Wolfbats!",5,1,5
,"Korra growls at the White Fall Wolfbats, as Asami runs to Mako and throws her arms around his neck.",5,1,5
Asami,"Great job! [To Korra as they both look at her while embracing.] What a comeback, Korra. I've never seen a hat trick like that.",5,1,5
Korra,"Thanks! [Slowly approaches the pair.] But, if it hadn't been for you and your father, we wouldn't have had the chance to play. So thank you.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Uh, if everyone's done with the little ""thank you"" party, need some medical attention over here.",5,1,5
Korra,"Ooh, let me help! [Places both hands on his shoulder.]",5,1,5
Bolin,"[In a angry, yet joking manner.] Owww! Gah! Haven't you hurt me enough, woman?",5,1,5
Korra,"Relax, I'm a healer! [Bends some water out of a bucket and puts it over Bolin's shoulder and begins to heal.] I learned from Katara, the best there is.",5,1,5
Bolin,"No, no, oh- ooh! That's the stuff!",5,1,5
Korra,"Bolin, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to let things get so out of hand.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Ahh, I'll be all right. But we had fun together, didn't we?",5,1,5
Korra,"I had a great time, honestly! You are one of a kind, Bolin.",5,1,5
Bolin,"Please, go on. I enjoy praise.",5,1,5
Ring announcer,"Your winners, the Wolfbats!",5,1,5
Korra,What? How is it over already?,5,1,5
Shiro Shinobi,"With a brutal round one knockout, the defending champs secure their spot in the finals. [Cut to the Mo Ce Mongoose Lizards being helped out of the pool by medics with stretchers. The waterbender on the team even has a large hole in the glass of his helmet.] I hope the Ferrets know a good doctor, 'cause they're gonna need one!",5,1,5
,Close-up on the astonished faces of the three Fire Ferrets as the episode ends. Fade to credits.,5,1,5
,"The episode opens up to a zooming in aerial shot of the Pro-bending Arena. Cut to a close-up shot of a net as two earth disks fly in it and fall to the ground. Switch to Bolin as he quickly levitates and throws two more disks straight at the camera. The camera quickly pans to the left to show Mako throwing two fire punches and a flaming arc with his foot at the camera. The camera quickly moves on to Korra moving a small water blob around a bit before launching it forward. The scene switches to three images of Tahno suspended on a rope; the first one gets cut in two by Bolin's earth disk tearing through it, the second one gets incinerated completely by Mako's fire blast, and Korra's water blob takes off a large portion of the third image.

Radio host,"[Voice-over.] You're listening to ""The Music Hour""! [Korra lets out another triumphant shout, and starts to confidently walk around.] Brought to you by Cabbage Corp, [Cut to Pabu who is asleep next to the radio.] Republic City's trusted name in technology for over fifty years.",6,1,6
Korra,"[In an upbeat tone while picking up a towel.] Man, I got a good feeling about tonight. I don't care if we are the underdogs. We can take those pompous Wolfbats.",6,1,6
Mako,"[Takes off his helmet.] It's going to be our toughest match ever, but I think you're right.",6,1,6
Bolin,"[Hugs Mako. Imitating announcer.] Introducing your new champs, the fantastic Fire Ferrets!",6,1,6
,The radio begins to broadcast static and changes to Amon's speech as he interrupts the program. Korra looks at the radio in alarm.,6,1,6
Amon,"Good morning, citizens of Republic City. This is Amon. [Pabu squeaks and runs away from the radio.] I hope you all enjoyed last night's pro-bending match, because it will be the last. [Mako and Bolin walk up to the radio.] It's time for this city to stop worshiping bending athletes as if they were heroes. I am calling on the council to shut down the bending arena [Mako looks at Bolin and Korra before looking at the radio again.] and cancel the finals, or else there will be severe consequences.",6,1,6
,Static returns and the radio is silent.,6,1,6
Bolin,That guy's got some nerve.,6,1,6
Mako,You think the council will give in?,6,1,6
Korra,I'm not waiting to find out. We need to get to City Hall.,6,1,6

Tenzin,"[Stands up from his chair; stern.] Korra, you shouldn't be here. This is a closed meeting.",6,1,6
Korra,"As the Avatar and a pro-bending player, I have a right to be heard. You can't cancel the finals.",6,1,6
Tenzin,"I know winning the championship means a lot to you. But as far as I'm concerned, we need to shut the arena down.",6,1,6
Korra,"What about the rest of you? Tarrlok, there's no way you're backing down from Amon, right?",6,1,6
Tarrlok,"Actually, [Stands.] Tenzin and I agree for once.",6,1,6
Tenzin,The council is unanimous. We're closing the arena.,6,1,6
Mako,No!,6,1,6
Bolin,You can't!,6,1,6
Korra,"[To Tarrlok.] I-I don't understand. I thought you, of all people, would take a stand against Amon.",6,1,6
Tarrlok,"While I am still committed to bringing that lunatic to justice, I will not put innocent lives at stake just so you and your friends can play a game.",6,1,6
Mako,"[Stepping forward.] Pro-bending might only be a game to you, but think of what it means to the city! Right now the arena is the one place where benders and nonbenders gather together ... in-in peace! To watch benders ...",6,1,6
Bolin,Beat each other up! In peace! [Pointing.] It's an inspiration to everyone!,6,1,6
Tarrlok,"I appreciate your naive idealism, but you're ignoring the reality of the situation.",6,1,6
Korra,"The reality is if you close the arena, you let Amon win!",6,1,6
Bolin,"[Points to Korra.] Yes, exactly what she said! Yes!",6,1,6
Tarrlok,"I'm sorry, but our decision has been made. This meeting is adjourned.",6,1,6
,"Tarrlok picks up the gavel. A metal cable knocks off the gavel head and Tarrlok gasps. Everyone turns to look toward the entrance of the courtroom as Lin enters the scene and coils her cable back, looking at the council.",6,1,6
Lin,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I agree with the Avatar.",6,1,6
Tarrlok,You do?,6,1,6
Korra,"Yeah, you do?",6,1,6
Lin,"I expected this kind of cut-and-run response from Tenzin. [Brief shot of Tenzin looking on indifferently.] But the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.",6,1,6
Tenzin,"[Cut back to Tenzin and Tarrlok.] We must prevent the conflict between benders and nonbenders from escalating into all-out war! [Cut briefly to Tarrlok shifting his eyes.] The council is not changing its position, Lin.",6,1,6
Tarrlok,"Now just a moment, Tenzin. Let us hear what our esteemed Chief of Police has in mind. [Tenzin grunts and folds his arms.]",6,1,6
Lin,"If you keep the arena open, my metalbenders and I will provide extra security during the championship match. There's no better force to deal with the chi blockers. Our armor is impervious to their attacks.",6,1,6
Tarrlok,Are you saying that you will personally take responsibility for the safety of the spectators in the arena? [Tenzin looks at Tarrlok with a mixture of anger and suspicion.],6,1,6
Lin,[Determined.] I guarantee it.,6,1,6
Tarrlok,"[Somewhat scornfully and sarcastically.] It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record. [Turns to the council.] If she is confident her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote. [Raises hand.] Who else is with me? [The other three council members raise their hands as Tenzin turns away in disappointment.] The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals.",6,1,6
,The Fire Ferrets jump in their cheering.,6,1,6
Bolin,All right!,6,1,6

Tenzin,Tarrlok's playing you and I don't want to see you get hurt.,6,1,6
Lin,I know what I am doing and the risks that come with it.,6,1,6
Tenzin,"In that case, I'm going to be by your side during the match.",6,1,6
Lin,[Annoyed.] You don't need to babysit me.,6,1,6
Tenzin,It's for Korra. I want to make sure she's safe.,6,1,6
Lin,[Throws her hands up in the air in annoyance.] Do what you want! It's not like I've ever been able to stop you before.,6,1,6
Korra,"[Walks up to them.] Excuse me, Chief Beifong. I wanted to thank you for your help, [Lin ignores her completely as she walks away.] it ... really ... means a lot ... [Annoyed, she turns and talks to Tenzin while pointing at her.] What is her deal? Even when she's on my side, she's against me!",6,1,6
Tenzin,"I've known Lin since we were children, she's always been ... [Tenzin pauses as he tries to find the right word.] challenging.",6,1,6
Korra,What did your father do to make her hate the Avatar so much?,6,1,6
Tenzin,My father and Lin got along famously. [Turns his head away.] I'm afraid her issues ... are with me.,6,1,6
Korra,"[Gasps in realization.] Wait a second ... [Smiles knowingly.] it all makes sense now! [Emphasizes her words with hand gestures.] You and Beifong, Beifong and you. You two were a [Brings her hands together.] couple!",6,1,6
Tenzin,[Shocked.] What! How-? [Nervously glances around to see if anyone else is around.] Where'd you get that idea?,6,1,6
Korra,Ha! [Pointing at him.] Your wife.,6,1,6
Tenzin,[Angrily muttering while looking away.] Criminy! I'll have to have a word with her.,6,1,6
Korra,"[Folds her arms, smugly.] So ... Pema stole you from Beifong. I'm surprised our ""esteemed Chief of Police"" didn't throw her in jail.",6,1,6
Tenzin,"[Korra looks at him with a pleased expression.] Oh, she tried. [The camera slowly zooms toward Tenzin.] Anyway, Pema didn't steal me, Lin and I had been growing apart for some time. We both had different goals in li- [Comes to a realization. The camera quickly zooms out to show Korra again.] Why am I even telling you this? It all happened a long time ago and we've moved passed it.",6,1,6
Korra,"Hm, apparently Beifong hasn't.",6,1,6
Tenzin,"What do you ... [Stammers in confusion.] Of course she has! Anyway, this is none of your business! [Walks away quickly in annoyance and anger.]",6,1,6
Korra,"[Waving teasingly.] See you at home, Mr. Heartbreaker! [Tenzin hangs his head in embarrassment and Korra laughs as he walks away.]",6,1,6

Tenzin,How is the security sweep going?,6,1,6
Lin,[Quickly and bluntly.] Fine.,6,1,6
Tenzin,They've checked underneath the stands?,6,1,6
Lin,[In the same manner.] Yes.,6,1,6
Tenzin,And you have enough officers to cover all points of entry?,6,1,6
Lin,"[Turns her head to Tenzin.] I have the skies, the bay, and every nook and cranny of this place covered. [Turns her head back.] Now leave me alone and let me do my job.",6,1,6
Tenzin,"[Saddened.] Lin, with so much on the line it would be nice if we could help each other out, at least for one night.",6,1,6
Lin,"[Looks at him, her expression softening.] Like old times?",6,1,6
Tenzin,Like old times.,6,1,6
Lin,"[Less harshly.] Okay, I'll try to be less abrasive than usual.",6,1,6
Tenzin,I would appreciate that.,6,1,6

Shiro Shinobi,[Voice-over.] The anticipation is palpable as we are just moments away from the championship match. [Cut inside the arena.] Will the Wolfbats' ferocity help them repeat as champs?

Bolin,"[Whispering to Pabu.] You're on, Pabu.",6,1,6
,"Pabu jumps down and does his trick by moving around on his front paws before doing some backflips while Bolin uses an earth disk, removing the center for Pabu to backflip through and back, ending the performance with one paw standing.",6,1,6
Bolin,Yes! Nailed it! [Whispering to his teammates.] He's so talented!,6,1,6
Ring announcer,"And their opponents, the three timed defending champions, the White Falls Wolfbats!",6,1,6

Shiro Shinobi,"Tahno tries to clean the Avatar's clock with some dirty water boxing. [Mako firebends and misses while Ming takes two earth disks and kicks them to Mako, followed by two more, which is enough to force him back to zone two.] Ming shakes off Mako's attack and returns the favor. [Shaozu flips forward while Bolin kicks some earth disks toward him. One of his disks bounces off the side ropes and hits Shaozu, knocking him against the fence.] Shaozu gets fancy, but Bolin ricochets a disk off the ropes and says 'No, thank you sir!'",6,1,6
Mako,[To Bolin in a cheerful tone.] Nice shot!,6,1,6

Shiro Shinobi,"The waterbenders slug it out, looking evenly matched. [Tahno waterbends a prolonged stream of water at Bolin, forcing the earthbender into zone three.] Tahno gets a little too worked up and unleashes a deluge on Bolin that would certainly elicit a foul.

Tahno and Shaozu both attack Korra as Mako rolls out of the way of an oncoming disk and attempts a fire blast back.] I don't know what match the refs are watching but it's obviously not this one.

,"Korra narrows her eyes and waterbends at Tahno. Tahno dodges it but gets hit under the chin by a stream of water. The scene rewinds to show the replay from a farther distance.

[Cut to the Fire Ferrets, who have regained consciousness. Amon continues speaking in the background.] I'm happy to tell you that the [Close-up of Fire Ferrets.] time for change has finally come. Very soon, the current tyrannical bending regime will be replaced by a fair-minded Equalist government. You and your children will no longer have to walk the streets afraid!

Amon,"[Cut to Amon.] For centuries, benders have possessed an unnatural advantage over ordinary people. [The shot changes to the stands where two Equalists hold out their electrical gloves near the spectators threateningly.] But thankfully, modern technology has provided us with a way to even out the playing field. [Cut to a closer shot of an Equalist as the camera zooms out to show the electrical glove he holds out.] Now anyone can hold the power of a chi blocker in their hand. [Cut to Amon, camera circles around him.] My followers and I will not rest until the entire city achieves equality, and once that goal is achieved, we will equalize the rest of the world.

Mako,I still can't believe they're shutting this place down.,7,1,7
Bolin,"[Distantly.] Yeah. We had some good memories here, didn't we?",7,1,7
Korra,[Excitedly while running up the stairs.] Guys! Great news. You don't have to go back on the streets. I talked to Tenzin and made all the arrangements. You can come live on Air Temple Island with me!,7,1,7
Mako,"Oh, we'd love to, but ...",7,1,7

Korra,[Sits down on a bench by the pool. Slightly sarcastically.] Looks like you guys settled right in.,7,1,7
Mako,"[Swimming toward Korra followed by Asami.] Pretty much, [Somewhat mockingly.] except someone forgot to ask her father if we could stay here.",7,1,7
Asami,"[Catches up to Mako.] Yeah, but I smoothed it over with him. It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.",7,1,7
Bolin,"[Gets out of the pool next to Korra with Pabu on his shoulder.] This is the greatest place in the world! Watch this, watch this. [Speaks in a more formal voice.] Fetch me my towel, good sir.",7,1,7
Butler,"Yes, Master ... Bolin. [Grabs a folded up towel and walks toward Bolin.]",7,1,7
Bolin,"[Pabu climbs onto Bolin's head.] Master Bolin! Ha, I love this guy. [Holds out his arms. To the butler.] Now pat me dry.",7,1,7
Butler,As you wish. [Rolls up the towel and pats down Bolin as he moves to allow him to do that.],7,1,7

Butler,"Wouldn't dream of it, sir. [Puts the towel over Pabu, who is still sitting on Bolin's head, and rubs him dry. A moment later, Pabu's fur becomes bushy as he squeaks. As the butler turns around, Bolin jumps into the water again right away and the butler looks annoyed.]",7,1,7
Korra,"[To Asami as she swims over to her; somewhat dismayed.] So, what do you have planned for us today? Let me guess, shopping, makeovers ...",7,1,7
Bolin,"[Jumps onto Mako, pushing him into the water; raising his hand while speaking in an excited tone.] Ooh, Ooh! I vote makeovers! [Mako returns the favor as he yelps.]",7,1,7
Asami,"[Climbs the ladder out of the pool, and turns her head to face Korra.] I had something a little more exciting in mind.",7,1,7

Asami,"Pretty cool, huh?",7,1,7
Korra,[Watches in amazement.] Way cooler than a makeover.,7,1,7
Asami,This is where Future Industries test-drives their Satomobiles. Ever been behind the wheel?,7,1,7
Korra,The only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.,7,1,7
Asami,You want me to take you for a spin?,7,1,7
Korra,"[Turns to Asami, a close-up on Korra's face.] Let's do it!",7,1,7
,"Two Satomobiles stand next to each other. Korra puts on goggles, she is sitting behind Asami. A man is sitting in the other car. The race starts as a man in blue waves a white flag in front of the cars. Asami falls behind first, but smiles and catches up fast as Mako and Bolin cheer from the sidelines. She overtakes the other mobile, her back wheel grazing the wall. The man tries to catch up, but his front wheel and Asami's back wheel touch and his car starts swaying. Asami wins the race, stops the car and both girls get off.",7,1,7
Korra,[Thrilled.] That was amazing! I didn't think we'd make it.,7,1,7
Asami,"Well, you can't be afraid to mix it up sometimes.",7,1,7
Korra,"I gotta admit, I had you pegged wrong. I thought you were kind of ... prissy. [Raises hand; quickly.] Eh-No offense!",7,1,7
Asami,"[Laughing.] It's all right, people usually assume that I'm daddy's helpless little girl, but I can handle myself. I mean, I've been in self-defense classes since I was this high. [Indicates her height with a hand, holding it next to her waist.] My dad made sure that I would always be able to protect myself.",7,1,7
Korra,Smart guy.,7,1,7
,"The scene changes to the mansion. Korra, Asami, Mako and Bolin enter through the door.",7,1,7
Bolin,"Emergency, emergency coming through, beep beep! [Runs toward the bathroom with his hands covering his groin.]",7,1,7
Korra,"[To Asami.] Uh, is there another bathroom I can use?",7,1,7
Asami,"We have a lady's powder room upstairs, [Mako stands next to her.] first door on your right. You can freshen up in there.",7,1,7
Korra,Thanks.,7,1,7
,"Cuts to Korra washing and drying her hands. She notices and picks up the powder sponge and looks at it intensely, before smashing it onto her face. A powder cloud covers her face and Korra starts choking. As she leaves the room, she hears a voice.",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"No, no! No, I assure you, everything is going exactly as planned. [Korra looks around and sneaks toward the room where the voice is coming from.] Uh-um, yes ... luckily, the Cabbage Corp investigation has bought us enough time. [Korra looks into the room through the keyhole and sees a person sitting in a chair.] Trust me, by the end of the week ... [The person stands up and Korra sees it is Mr. Sato.] we'll be ready to strike! [He hangs up and Korra hurries away.]",7,1,7
,Cuts to the butler spraying perfume all over Bolin and Mako and Asami standing behind them. Korra runs past them.,7,1,7
Asami,You're leaving? But I-I thought ...,7,1,7
Korra,"[Turns around.] Uh, sorry! I forgot, I'm supposed to airsit, I mean babybend, I-I mean babysit the airbender kids. See you later!",7,1,7
,Scene changes to outside at nighttime where Korra talks to Tenzin and Lin.,7,1,7
Tenzin,"So, you think Mr. Sato manufactured those gloves for the Equalists then framed Cabbage Corp?",7,1,7
Lin,"That's a bold accusation, but what proof do you have?",7,1,7
Korra,"Well, I don't exactly have proof, but I know what I heard. Sato's up to something.",7,1,7
Lin,He does have the means ... and he has a motive.,7,1,7
Tenzin,That's right.,7,1,7
Korra,[Curiously.] A motive? What is it?,7,1,7
Tenzin,"Twelve years ago, the Agni Kai Triad robbed Sato's mansion. A firebender killed Sato's wife during the break in.",7,1,7
Korra,[Saddened.] That's terrible.,7,1,7
Tenzin,It was tragic. It's possible that he's been harboring anti-bending sentiment all this time.,7,1,7
Lin,Maybe we should look at Mr. Sato a little more closely.,7,1,7
,"Cut to the door of the Sato mansion, which the butler opens. Korra, Lin, and Tenzin enter. Tenzin and Lin walk upstairs and Korra walks behind them, passing Mako and Asami.",7,1,7
Mako,[Stops Korra.] What's going on? Why are they asking Hiroshi more questions?,7,1,7
Korra,"I overheard him on the phone yesterday. Asami, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think your father might be involved with the Equalists.",7,1,7
Asami,[Incredulously.] What? I don't believe this. [Walks upstairs.],7,1,7
Mako,You spied on Hiroshi? [Korra takes a step back.] What's your problem? [Follows Asami.],7,1,7
,"Inside Hiroshi Sato's office, Lin and Tenzin stand in front of Hiroshi's desk.",7,1,7
Lin,"Mr. Sato, we just have a few follow-up questions for you.",7,1,7
Asami,[Opens the door and walks in.] My father is innocent. Just because we're not benders doesn't mean we support those awful Equalists. [Mako and Korra follow her into the office.],7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,Equalists? [Asami stands next to him.] Is that what this is about? I can assure you I have nothing to do with those radicals.,7,1,7
Mako,"[To Korra.] Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about, Korra.",7,1,7
Korra,"[Pointing to Hiroshi Sato.] I overheard you on the phone. You said the Cabbage Corp investigation bought you time, and you're getting ready to strike. Explain that!",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"[Laughs.] This is all just a misunderstanding, resulting from the young Avatar's overactive imagination. My number one competitor was knocked out of the game. It's providing me an opportunity to strike the market with a new line of Satomobiles. [Lin averts her eyes.] It's just business. Nothing nefarious. [Lin and Tenzin look at each other.]",7,1,7
Tenzin,"[Turning to Hiroshi Sato.] In order to put all suspicions to rest, might we have a look into your factories and warehouses?",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"[Asami sighs in annoyance, hands on her hips, but Hiroshi Sato raises his hands to stop her from speaking further.] If you feel it's necessary, you're welcome to search all of Future Industries.",7,1,7
,Cuts to the Future Industries factory with a news reporter broadcasting.,7,1,7
News reporter,"[Narrating a newsreel.] Is it possible, presidents of Cabbage Corp and Future Industries both have Equalist ties, or did Hiroshi Sato frame his longtime rival, Lau Gan-Lan? [Korra stands beside Naga as she sniffs the boxes.] Or did Chief Beifong just plain arrest the wrong man? [Lin breaks open a box to see the contents.] So far the investigation has yielded no evidence to incriminate Sato. [Wider shot where metalbender cops check inside the boxes.]",7,1,7
,"Cut to the outside of the factory as the metalbender cops are lifted into the police airship while Lin and Tenzin watch. Korra rides in on Naga, and jumps down to approach them.",7,1,7
Korra,I can't believe we didn't find anything.,7,1,7
Lin,It would appear Hiroshi is innocent.,7,1,7
Asami,"[Approaches with Mako, annoyed.] Okay, you did your search. Now you can all leave.",7,1,7
Lin,[Glares at Asami.] Hmm.,7,1,7
,"Mako signals to Korra, and they move away to have a private conversation.",7,1,7
Mako,"So, I hope you're convinced now.",7,1,7
Korra,"No, I'm not! I don't care how cooperative Hiroshi is being, I know he's lying.",7,1,7
Mako,[Irritably.] Why are you doing this? Are you that jealous of me and Asami? [Pointing at Korra.],7,1,7
Korra,[Gasps.] What? [Shaking her head.] Don't be ridiculous! That has nothing to do with it!,7,1,7
Mako,"[Bluntly.] If you don't drop this, consider our friendship over.",7,1,7
Korra,I'm sorry. Hiroshi is not the man you think he is.,7,1,7
Mako,[Closing his eyes.] Hmph.,7,1,7
,"Mako walks away to Asami, one arm wrapping around her shoulder, and leaves as Korra sighs and turns away. A worker in the background slides the factory's door shut and turns to see Korra, the view changes to a close-up of his eyes. Cut to Lin and Tenzin standing near Korra, who strokes Naga as the worker approaches her. He places a note in Korra's hand as he walks past her. Korra, surprised, looks around to see who handed her the note, to no avail. She opens the note and reads it. Looking at it with surprise, she turns to Lin and Tenzin.",7,1,7
Korra,"[To Lin and Tenzin.] I think you guys should hear this. [Reading the note.] ""If you want to find the truth, meet me under the north end of the Silk Road Bridge at midnight."" [Camera closes up on Korra's face.]",7,1,7
,"Cut to the police airship over the bridge at nighttime as the camera moves down to see Korra, Lin and Tenzin walking to the north end.",7,1,7
Warehouse worker,"[Signaling to Korra and the others.] Psst. [Korra, Lin and Tenzin turn their heads.] Over here. [Warehouse worker comes out from hiding behind the pillar.] Listen, I joined the Equalists because I believed in what Amon said. I thought he could make life better for us nonbenders. But I didn't sign up for this ... [Turns his head toward them.] this war.",7,1,7
Lin,[Curiously.] What do you have on Hiroshi Sato?,7,1,7
Warehouse worker,He manufactured those gloves [Turns his body around.] for the Equalists.,7,1,7
Korra,[Confidently.] I knew it!,7,1,7
Warehouse worker,[Lifting up the collar to hide his face.] And there are rumors he's working on something even bigger. Some new kind of weapon.,7,1,7
Tenzin,[Lifting his hand in confusion.] We searched all of Future Industries and found nothing.,7,1,7
Warehouse worker,That's because he has a secret factory.,7,1,7
Korra,[Determined.] Where?,7,1,7
Warehouse worker,[Camera closes up to his face.] It's right underneath the Sato Mansion.,7,1,7
,"Korra, Lin and Tenzin gasp and look at him in shock. Cut to Korra, Lin and Tenzin on an airship.",7,1,7
Tenzin,Raiding the Sato Mansion is a risky move with Tarrlok breathing down your neck. If we're wrong ...,7,1,7
Lin,I know. I can kiss my job goodbye. But protecting Republic City is all I care about. We can't let Amon get his hands on this new weapon.,7,1,7
,"Cut to see the airship over the Sato mansion and switch to the brothers with Asami sitting down in the living room; Bolin is eating from the bowl of fruit while Mako takes out a LP from the cover and shows it to Asami. The metalbender cops burst into the living room, causing Bolin to raise his arms in fear.",7,1,7
Asami,[Surprised and angrily.] What are you doing here?,7,1,7
Lin,We have a reason to believe that there's a factory hidden below the mansion.,7,1,7
Asami,[Narrowing her eyes.] I think I would've noticed if there were a factory underneath my house. The lies you people come up with just to persecute my father.,7,1,7
Tenzin,Where is your father?,7,1,7
Asami,"In his workshop, behind the house.",7,1,7
,"Changes to the outside of Hiroshi's workshop, metalbender cops guard the area as they all walk toward the place. The metalbender cops burst into the workshop to find no one in the room.",7,1,7
Asami,[Searching.] Dad? Hello?,7,1,7
Officer,"[Approaches Lin.] Chief, the estate's been secured. No one has left the workshop since we arrived.",7,1,7
Lin,Perhaps we just couldn't see him leaving.,7,1,7
,"Lin walks into the middle of the room with her hands behind her back. She raises her leg and metalbends her left sole, removing it to expose her bare foot to perform her seismic sense.",7,1,7
Lin,There's a tunnel beneath the workshop running deep into the mountainside.,7,1,7
Asami,"[In disbelief; slightly angrily.] What? There's no tunnel. [Lin looks at the floor and metalbends to remove the metal layer, exposing the stairs and an elevator going down as they walk toward it.]",7,1,7
Bolin,[Whispering to Asami.] Do you think your dad knows about this tunnel?,7,1,7
Asami,[Confused at the discovery.] I don't understand. There must be an explanation.,7,1,7
Korra,[To Asami.] Maybe you don't know everything about your father. [Somewhat sympatheically.] I'm sorry.,7,1,7
Lin,"[To her officers.] Officers, [Pointing at the stairs.] into the tunnel. Be cautious. [Officers walk toward the stairs. Mako, Bolin and Asami start walking toward it until they are stopped by Lin.] Uh-uh, you three stay up here. [To Song.] Officer Song, keep an eye on them.",7,1,7
,"Song salutes her as Mako, Bolin and Asami look at the group. As they walk down, Korra turns her head and looks at the three in sadness as Mako turns his head away with guilt. The elevator takes the group down until it stops and they cautiously walk into a massive room that has posters of Amon hanging up. There are large robotic machines on the sides.",7,1,7
Lin,Not your average backyard workshop.,7,1,7
Korra,[Looking at the large robotic machines.] And I'm guessing those are the new weapons. [Lin and Tenzin also look at the machines.],7,1,7
Tenzin,"Hiroshi was lying all right, but where is he? [Suddenly, a metal wall shoots up to block the entrance. The three upstairs hear the noise.]",7,1,7
Bolin,What was that?,7,1,7
Mako,We need to get down there and see what's going on.,7,1,7
Song,[Strictly.] Absolutely not. You're staying put until the chief comes back.,7,1,7
Mako,"[Bolin and Mako look at each other, hatching a plan.] All right, we'll stay put. But could we wait outside or something? It's so dusty in this workshop.",7,1,7
Song,No! We're waiting right here!,7,1,7
Mako,"Okay, but don't blame me if I start sne- [Begins to sneeze.] if I start sn-sn-sneez- [Continues sneezing.]",7,1,7
Song,"What's your problem, bub?",7,1,7
Mako,"I'm about to- [Song approaches him and Mako firebends his sneeze, causing Song to move back and trip over by Bolin's earthbent rock. Bolin jumps on him and they tie him up to a barrel as he struggles.] Sorry pal, we know you were just doing your job.",7,1,7
Bolin,"Yeah, just stay put until the chief comes back. That's sounds very familiar doesn't it, why? Because you said it. [The three walk toward the stairs, but Mako stops Asami by putting his hands on her shoulders.]",7,1,7
Mako,"Asami, you should stay here. We'll check it out.",7,1,7
Asami,[Determined.] I have to find out the truth about my father.,7,1,7
Mako,"I understand. That's why I'm going down, to find out for you. Please.",7,1,7
Asami,"[Disappointed.] All right. [As the brothers walk down the stairs, Asami says to Mako.] Be careful.",7,1,7
,"Asami clasps her hands together tightly as she looks down with uncertainty. Meanwhile, down in the factory, Lin tries the bend the seemingly metal wall, but to no avail.",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"[From the speakers.] I'm afraid you won't be able to metalbend that wall, Chief Beifong. [Green lights are turned on around them, causing them all to shield their eyes from the glares.] It's solid platinum. [The robotic machines come to life and approach the group.] My mecha tanks are platinum as well. [Changes to see Hiroshi Sato in the mecha tank.] Not even your renowned mother could bend a metal so pure.",7,1,7
Korra,"[Angrily and accusing.] Hiroshi, I knew you were a lying, no good Equalist! Come out here and-",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"[Camera zooms out from a close-up of Hiroshi's face who is inside the tank.] And do what, young Avatar? Face the wrath of your bending? No. I think I'll fight from inside here where my odds are a little more ... equal.",7,1,7
Lin,That source was a set-up! You lured us down here! [The mecha tanks come closer to surround the benders.],7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,Guilty as charged.,7,1,7
,"The battle begins when Hiroshi Sato shoots out a grappler to capture them. Lin, Korra and Tenzin evade it. Another mecha tank attacks the metalbender cops but they dodge, shooting out cables to wrap around its arms, holding it down. Two more metalbender cops run up and metalbend to hold off another mecha tank. Lin runs forward, dodging the grappler and earthbends herself up into the air. She metalbends daggers from her wrist armor, and lands onto the head of the mecha tank. She breaks the glass by stabbing the front, missing the Equalist inside who dodges. She keeps stabbing, making the machine move backward and fall over. While Lin attacks the mecha tank, Hiroshi Sato moves his own mecha tank forward as Korra firebends to no effect. Tenzin airbends Hiroshi Sato back and Korra as looks over her shoulder at the unexpected help. As he airbends, the metalbender cops have a difficult time holding the other mecha tanks down, their cable spools starting to spark and overheat with the effort. As they are pulled forward by the tank, they raise the earth with their bending in an attempt to find more foothold to withstand the pull. The mecha tanks wrap the cables around their arms and conduct electricity, electrocuting the officers until they lose consciousness and release their grip. Lin attempts to deliver another blow, but is grabbed from behind with a grappler, knocking her forward and against a metal support beam. She is subsequently flung across the room and lands hard on the ground, where she remains unconscious as well. Tenzin and Korra help each other as they use their airbending and firebending respectively to push Hiroshi Sato's mecha tank into the corner. Furious, Hiroshi Sato shoots a grappler in Korra's direction. Korra repeatedly back flips to avoid the attack. Having moved out of the path of the weapon, she earthbends a rock out of the ground and launches it at Hiroshi. At that moment, she is grabbed and shoved forward by another mecha tank's grappling hook, knocking her unconscious by slamming her against a large metal pipe.",7,1,7
Tenzin,Korra!,7,1,7
,"Tenzin uses his airbending to cushion Korra's fall, who grunts as she connects with the floor. Now alone, Tenzin is fighting off Hiroshi Sato and an Equalist using his airbending and an air wheel to evade their attacks. He jumps up, but Hiroshi Sato shoots bolas combined with an electric disk. Tenzin is ensnared with it and grunts in pain as he is electrocuted. He roughly lands on the ground, unconscious. Hiroshi Sato exits his mecha tank and climbs down. As Hiroshi lets his gaze travel over the warehouse, the scene changes between a close-up image of an unconscious Lin, Tenzin, and Korra, before changing back to a frontal shot of Hiroshi.",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"Well, I'd say that was a near flawless test run. [To the Equalists, pointing to the unconscious people.] Load everyone into the transports and deliver them to Amon!",7,1,7
,"A hole is earthbent from the ground, and Bolin pops up from underneath along with Mako. They look around until they notice with horror the metalbenders being dragged into the trucks.",7,1,7
Bolin,Oh no.,7,1,7
Mako,"Korra was right. We gotta do something, quick!",7,1,7
,"Bolin and Mako sneak around the factory, getting closer to Tenzin, Lin and Korra. Mako hoists Korra onto his back, while Bolin does the same with Tenzin after untying the bola wrapped around him. They are about to grab Lin to drag her away as well, but are spotted by Hiroshi Sato and the Lieutenant.",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"Not so fast, boys. [Conducts electricity from his gloves.]",7,1,7
Bolin,"[Mako drops Lin's arm. Bolin does the same and uses Tenzin's arms to express his surprise.] Hello, Mr. Sato. Wow! What a really swell, scary factory you have here under your giant mansion.",7,1,7
Mako,"[Close-up of his face; angrily to Hiroshi Sato.] Sponsoring our team, supporting the Avatar. It was all just a big cover.",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"Yes, and the most difficult part was watching my daughter traipse around with a firebending street rat like you! [Conducts electricity from the gloves as he and the Lieutenant approach them.]",7,1,7
Asami,"Dad, stop! [Hiroshi turns around in surprise. Asami closes her eyes and turns her head away before looking back at her father in sadness.] Why?",7,1,7
Hiroshi Sato,"[Ashamed.] Sweetie, I wanted to keep you out of this as long as I could. [Korra regains consciousness.] But now you know the truth, please, forgive me. [Close-up on Asami.] These people, [Pointing at the Fire Ferrets.] these benders. They took away your mother, the love of my life. They've ruined the world, but with Amon we can fix it and build a perfect world together. We can help people like us, everywhere! [Takes off one of his gloves and offers it to Asami.] Join me, Asami.",7,1,7
,"Asami looks at her father with uncertainty, but she hesitatingly steps toward him. She looks at the glove with fear, trembling as she reaches for it. The Fire Ferrets look at her in sadness as she grabs the glove off her father, slipping her hand into the glove.",7,1,7
Mako,[In disbelief.] No ...,7,1,7
Asami,"[To her father.] I love you, Dad.",7,1,7
,"She electrocutes her father until he loses consciousness, revealing it was a ruse. The Lieutenant attacks her, but she uses self-defense techniques to easily defeat him with his own electrified kali stick. Mako and Korra are stunned at the fact that she took them down so easily by herself. Lin regains consciousness as the mecha tanks notice them.",7,1,7
Mako,[To everyone.] Let's get out of here!,7,1,7
,"They all run to the large hole Mako and Bolin came in. Right before the mecha tanks attempt to capture them, Bolin earthbends the hole shut. The scene changes to the police airship floating away from the Sato mansion. Asami looks down at her former home in dismay as the camera switches to Lin lying down with Tenzin at her side.",7,1,7
Lin,"[To Tenzin.] My metalbenders are on their way to Amon, and it's all my fault. Tarrlok's right, I've failed as chief. First thing in the morning, I'm handing in my resignation.",7,1,7
Tenzin,[Adamantly.] No! You can't give up like this!,7,1,7
Lin,"[Sitting up.] I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find my officers and take Amon down. But I'm gonna do it my way, outside the law. [Tenzin looks at her with concern.]",7,1,7
Mako,"[Approaches Korra, apologetically.] I'm sorry I didn't believe you. But Asami's dad being an Equalist is not an easy thing to believe. Even now.",7,1,7
Korra,I know. I'm sorry this whole thing happened.,7,1,7
Mako,So ... does your offer to live in the Air Temple still stand?,7,1,7
Korra,"[Smiling.] Of course it does. And Asami's welcome, too.",7,1,7
Mako,[Gratefully.] Thank you so much.,7,1,7
Korra,"[Places her hand on Mako's shoulder.] After everything she's been through, she's going to need you, Mako.",7,1,7
,Mako nods his head and walks toward Asami to comfort her. Korra looks at them in sadness before turning away as the airship floats above the city. Cut to credits.,7,1,7
,"The episode opens with a ferry sailing toward Air Temple Island. Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin, leaning slightly over the railing with Pabu perched on his shoulder. He looks toward the island with an excited look upon his face. Mako and Asami, her arm wrapped around Mako, are standing behind Bolin, watching the island as well. Cut to a far off shot of Air Temple Island and the ferry pulls up at the port. The scene switches to a back shot of Korra, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo standing on the dock, waving at the people on the boat. Naga stands on the dock as well.",8,1,8
Ikki,[Excitedly.] You're finally here! [One Air Acolyte throws the anchor in the water while two others let down the ramp to allow the passengers to get off the boat.] Welcooome to Air Temple Island. [Close-up of Ikki's face.] Your new home.,8,1,8
Meelo,"[Cut to Meelo.] Yes, welcome to [Pointing at himself.] my domain.",8,1,8
Bolin,"[Frontal shot; Bolin is carrying his duffel bag over his right shoulder, and Mako and Asami descend the ramp behind him.] Well, aren't you sweet, [Slightly leans forward.] little monk child.",8,1,8
,Pabu jumps down from Bolin's shoulder and runs in between Meelo's legs before running to the right. Meelo bends over and looks through his legs at Pabu. He stands erect again.,8,1,8
Meelo,[Pointing at Pabu.] What's that fuzzy creature?,8,1,8
,"Pabu and Naga sniff each other's nose; Pabu erects himself on his hind legs, and gently touches Naga's nose with his left front paw.",8,1,8
Jinora,[Voice-over.] That is a fire ferret. [Frontal shot of her and Meelo as Jinora recites the facts with a finger up in the air.] An arboreal mammal common [Turns toward her brother.] to the bamboo forest of the central Earth Kingdom.,8,1,8
Ikki,[Jumps out from behind Jinora; gasps in delight.] He's cuuuute!,8,1,8
,"Ikki squees and runs off screen toward Pabu. Meelo airbends upward while an irritated Jinora plugs her ears by putting a finger into each of her ears to silence Ikki's shrieks. Cut to Pabu who hisses at Ikki and runs under Naga. The girl follows suit as she continues giggling with joy. Meelo descends down to jump on Naga's head, grabbing and pulling the polar bear dog's ears backward.",8,1,8
Meelo,[To Naga.] Yip yip! Fly sky bison! Fly!,8,1,8
,Naga does not react to Meelo's antics and Ikki continues to chase Pabu around the dock. Cut to Korra looking at the children.,8,1,8
Mako,[Walks toward Korra.] Thanks for sending the Air Acolytes to help us with the move.,8,1,8
Asami,"[Agreeing with Mako.] Yes, they've been amazing. [Places a hand up with praise.] Such tireless workers.",8,1,8
,Cut to a side view of the boat as are seen two Air Acolytes carrying several trunks of luggage. They are heard them grunting as they walk down the ramp.,8,1,8
Korra,"[Looking at the large stack of cases in surprise as the pair carry them off the boat.] Oh, I thought you were only bringing a [The pair of Air Acolytes stumble a bit causing the luggage to threaten to topple onto her while Korra reacts slightly by shrieking that word but the Air Acolytes manage to balance themselves in time.] few things.",8,1,8
Mako,"Trust me, [The Air Acolytes re-orientate themselves and they walk toward the island.] it could've been worse.",8,1,8
Korra,"No problem, everyone here wants you guys to feel welcome.",8,1,8
,"Cut to the gates of Air Temple Island. Naga playfully chases Pabu around as the group strolls behind them and walks toward the temple. Ikki runs around with her hands outstretched as she sings and hums gleefully. Cut to a side view shot of Asami, Mako, and Jinora. Asami looks down at Meelo with confusion as he grins at her.",8,1,8
Meelo,"You're pretty, can I have some of your hair? [Holds out his hand.]",8,1,8
Mako,[To Asami; jokingly while winking.] Looks like I have some competition.,8,1,8
Ikki,[Lifts her hands up as they stopped walking.] And now for the grand tour. [Speaks quickly as she points at each area.] The flying bison sleep in those caves down there. [Turns around.] And that's the temple Grandpa Aang built. [Turns around.] And that's the greenhouse where we grow the vegetables we eat. [Turns around to grin at them. The teens turn their heads back toward Ikki; cut to a close up of the airbender with a wide smile on her face.],8,1,8
Bolin,"I have a couple of questions. [Ikki stop smiling and looks at him as he tries to mimic her quick talk.] Is this an all vegetarian island? [Points at a direction.] Is that where you train airbending? [Grabs his shirt.] Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? Do we each get our own sky bison? And final question, how many trees are on this island? [Bends down to look at Ikki.]",8,1,8
Ikki,[Thinks and answers quickly with her hands behind her back while rocking back and forth slightly.] Yes. Yes. No. No. Ten thousand five hundred and fifty two. [Long pause from the others as they blink at Ikki in surprise.],8,1,8
Mako,"So, where are we going to be staying?",8,1,8
Meelo,You're a boy. [They turn toward Meelo.] Boys have to stay on the boys' side.,8,1,8
Jinora,[Puts her hands together.] I'd be happy to show you to the men's dormitory. [Jinora and Mako walk away.],8,1,8
Bolin,I'm a boy! [Follows the pair.],8,1,8
Korra,"Meelo, why don't you go with the boys too?",8,1,8
Meelo,"[Looks up at Asami and moves away.] We shall meet again soon, beautiful woman. [Runs after the brothers and Jinora.]",8,1,8
Korra,[To Asami as they walk.] Ikki and I will take you to your room this way.,8,1,8
,"Scene changes to show the outside of the girls dormitory before changing to the corridors where Korra, Asami and Ikki are walking.",8,1,8
Ikki,"[To Asami.] Asami, did you know Korra likes Mako?",8,1,8
,"Korra stops in her tracks as her eyes grow wide open in horror. Cut to the inside of her head as her face contorts in a dramatic background where Korra inhumanly screams at Ikki in horror, fire burning and lightning striking behind her before returning to reality. Korra looks around with fear as Asami looks uncomfortable with the topic.",8,1,8
Asami,"[Surprised.] Oh. [Shifts her eyes around.] Uh, no. I wasn't completely aware of that.",8,1,8
,"Korra grabs Asami's arm and drags her further along the corridor. Back shot of Korra as she slides open the doors, and moves to the side, smiling and gesturing to Asami in an inviting manner to enter the room. As Asami enters, Ikki walks up to the room to follow them, but Korra goes in after Asami and turns around, glaring at Ikki while slamming the doors shut in front of her, making her step back.",8,1,8
Ikki,[Surprised and angrily.] Hey!,8,1,8
Korra,"[From behind the door; just as angrily.] Run along, Ikki!",8,1,8
,"Ikki looks down and moans sadly. Suddenly, she looks up and acts out like an angry cat with glowing white eyes, making some cat noises as she claws at the air before growling at the doors and folding her arms in annoyance while looking away. Inside the room, Korra sighs and scratches her head awkwardly.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Sighs.] So, [Walks toward Asami.] here's your room. [Camera pans to show the room.] I know this is a little rustic compared to what you're used to.",8,1,8
Asami,"I think it's really charming [Walks to the window.] and the best part about it, nothing here reminds me of my father. [Turns her head to look at Korra.] Thank you for your hospitality. [Someone bangs on the door.]",8,1,8
Korra,"[Annoyed; Asami's eyes widen at Korra's outburst.] Ikki! I swear [Turns slightly to face and point at the door.] if you don't leave us alone, I'm gonna- [Tenzin slides open the doors. Cut to Korra's blanched out face; slightly higher pitched tone.] Uh, Tenzin! [Closes eyes in embarrassment; attempt at normal voice.] Come right in.",8,1,8
Tenzin,"[Side-shot as he walks toward them.] Good day, ladies. Asami, welcome to the island.",8,1,8
Asami,[Bowing down at Tenzin.] Thank you for having me. [Tenzin bows down to her.],8,1,8
Tenzin,"[To Korra.] Beifong's replacement, Saikhan, is going to be inducted as the new Chief of Police later. I think we should both be there.",8,1,8
,"Cut to the outside of the Police Headquarters, a large crowd standing at the front with Saikhan at the podium.",8,1,8
Saikhan,"It was an honor serving under Chief Beifong for so many years [Cut to a close-up on him along with the councilmen and policemen.] and I wish her a speedy recovery. It is with great humility that I take her place as the new Chief of Police. Republic City is facing a threat like none the world has ever seen but there is one man who's been effective against Amon's revolution, Councilman Tarrlok. [Tarrlok nods his head as reporters take his picture.] That is why for all matters involving the Equalists, I will report directly to him. [Korra and Tenzin turn their heads to Tarrlok with surprise.] The police department will lend any and all available resources to the councilman and his task force [Slams his fist down on the podium.] until we quell this insurgency.",8,1,8
Korra,[To Tenzin.] What is that weasel snake Tarrlok up to now?,8,1,8
,"They look at Tarrlok with disdain, and the camera cuts to a shot of the council chairman. Cut to an overview shot of the police headquarters, before focusing on Tarrlok again. As the crowd disperses after the inauguration, he gives the Fire Nation councilwoman a hands, who leaves with the other council members; he bows after them in their direction.",8,1,8
Tenzin,"[To Tarrlok; accusingly.] Tarrlok, I don't know what you did to get Chief Saikhan in your pocket but I highly doubt it was legal.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Oh, Tenzin. [Turns to him.] Always the conspiracy theorist. Did you ever consider Saikhan simply recognizes my talents and wants what is best for this city? [Tenzin grunts in disgust as Korra walks toward them.] Well, Avatar Korra. Long time, no see. Now that your little pro-bending distractions are over, I look forward to your return to my task force.",8,1,8
Korra,Ha! [Folds her arms.] Forget it! There's no way I'm rejoining your vanity project.,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"That is unfortunate to hear, but I'm sure you'll come to your senses as you have in the past.",8,1,8
Korra,"Don't hold your breath, bub. [Pointing at Tarrlok.] You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along. [Points at herself.] You played me, [Points out in the distance.] you played Beifong, [Points at Tarrlok again.] and now you're playing the new Chief too. [Swipes her hand aside, and walks up to Tarrlok.] Well, I got news for you. [Points at him.] You need me, [Points to herself.] but I don't need you. I'm the Avatar.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Side-view; somewhat scornfully and mockingly.] You're not, in fact, the Avatar. [Korra's face softens with surprise; cut to a frontal shot of Tarrlok.] You are merely a half-baked Avatar in training, which reminds me, how is your airbending going? [Side-view of Korra's face, as she looks at him with a sad expression.] Made any significant progress with that? [Korra looks down in defeat, clenching her teeth; close-up of a smug Tarrlok.] I didn't think so. [Frontal shot of a dejected Korra as Tarrlok turns away; somewhat angrily.] If you will not be part of my task force, then you had best stay out of my way.",8,1,8
,"He leaves as Tenzin places his hand on Korra's shoulder to comfort her, as she looks in Tarrlok's direction in anger. Aerial shot of Oogi flying over Republic City. Closer shot of Korra sitting on the saddle.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Frustrated.] I don't understand what's wrong with me. I've memorized nearly all of the practice forms, but I still can't produce a single measly puff of air! [Downcast.] I'm a failure.",8,1,8
Tenzin,[Frontal shot of him holding the reins.] No you're not. You just need to work through this airbending block.,8,1,8
Korra,[Sarcastically.] Amazing advice. I'll get right on that.,8,1,8
Tenzin,"[Slightly annoyed.] I wasn't finished yet. You see, Aang not only had his bending teachers, but also his past lives to call upon for guidance. Have you ever made contact with your past lives?",8,1,8
Korra,"No, of course I haven't. Didn't you get the memo from the White Lotus? I'm a spiritual failure, too.",8,1,8
Tenzin,You may have made a connection without realizing it. [Close shot of Korra.] Perhaps something you mistook as a dream?,8,1,8
Korra,"Maybe. I had a few weird hallucinations, [Shot of Tenzin from the back.] but I hardly even remember them.",8,1,8
Tenzin,[Turns toward Korra in surprise.] And did you see any previous Avatars in these visions?,8,1,8
Korra,I saw Aang. It seemed like he was in trouble. What do you think it means?,8,1,8
Tenzin,"Hmm, I don't know. [Strokes his beard.] But I urge you to meditate on these visions. [Further shot of the sky bison flying toward Air Temple Island.] I believe Aang's spirit must be trying to tell you something.",8,1,8
,"Fade to evening as the camera points toward Avatar Aang's statue. The scene turns into night time as the camera pans to show Korra sitting on the ledge on Air Temple Island, staring at the statue of Aang on Memorial island, tears rolling down her cheeks.",8,1,8
Mako,[Searches for her; off-screen.] Korra? You out here?,8,1,8
,Korra turns her head toward the voice and wipes away her tears as Pabu comes out from the bushes. Cut to a bush as Pabu's head peeks out and chirps.,8,1,8
Bolin,"[Yelling off-screen as Pabu runs toward her and climbs onto Korra's shoulder, wrapping himself around her.] Korraaa!",8,1,8
,"The ferret stops in front of Korra and starts licking away her tears. Bolin, Asami, and Mako find her and Pabu runs back to Bolin and climbs up onto his shoulder.",8,1,8
Bolin,There you are. [Reaches down so Pabu can climb onto him; worried.] Are you okay?,8,1,8
Korra,[Trying to act normal and shrugs.] I'm fine.,8,1,8
Mako,"[Persistently.] Come on, what's wrong? You can tell us.",8,1,8
Korra,[Cut to a close-up of Korra as she sighs.] How am I suppose to save this city when I can't even learn airbending? [Turns her head.] I'm the worst Avatar ever! [Turns her head back and hangs her head down.] I just feel ... alone.,8,1,8
Asami,"[Cut to a close-up of Asami and Mako.] No, that's nonsense! You're amazing!",8,1,8
Mako,[Agreeing with Asami.] Yeah and remember. Aang hadn't mastered all the elements when he was battling the Fire Nation. He was just a little kid.,8,1,8
Bolin,"[Pipes in.] And he wasn't alone. He had his friends to help him. Look, the arena might be shut down but we're still a team. The new Team Avatar!",8,1,8
Mako,"We got your back Korra, and we can save this city. [Asami, Bolin and Mako place their hands on each other.] Together.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Stand up, encouraged.] Yeah, let's do it!",8,1,8
,"Places her hand on top and Meelo suddenly descends and airbends down, farting on top on their hands as they express their shock and disgust by widening their eyes.",8,1,8
Meelo,"[Raises his arm, grinning.] Yeah, let's do it! [Continues to fart while speaking in confusion.] What are we doing? [The new team laughs heartily while Meelo grins goofily.]",8,1,8
,Scene changes to the gates of the temple to a night view of Republic City as the camera slowly pans out to reveal Bolin looking at the city.,8,1,8
Bolin,"[In a deep, dramatic voice.] Get ready, Republic City. [Cut to a frontal shot of Bolin as the rest assemble. Korra leads Naga next to Bolin and Mako stands on the other side.] You are about to be patrolled by Team Avatar.",8,1,8
Mako,"[Asami approaches the team wielding an electrified glove.] Asami, you always know how to accessorize your outfits.",8,1,8
Asami,I figure one way to fight Equalists is to use an Equalist weapon. [Conducts electricity from the glove.],8,1,8
Korra,"All right, [Punches palm.] Let's ride.",8,1,8
,"Camera pans out to reveal Mako, Asami, and Korra already seated on Naga.",8,1,8

,"Naga bends down, causing the New Team Avatar to slide off her and fall on top of each other. Naga growls and shakes her head. Cut to an embarrassed Korra as she stands up and places her hand on her head. She narrows her eyes in dismay as they look to the side.",8,1,8
Korra,"All right, scratch that. [Turns to her team.] Any other ideas?",8,1,8
Asami,[Cut to Asami as she stands up and flips her hair.] Hmm. [Rests a hand on her chin in thought.] I think I have the answer.,8,1,8
,"A garage opens, the headlights from a car shining on Mako, Bolin, and Korra. Asami starts up the car and drives out of the garage. The car swerves and stops in front of them.",8,1,8
Asami,You think this'll do?,8,1,8
,"Mako, Bolin, and Korra smile at her and they all jump into the car.",8,1,8
Mako,[Impressed.] I like the new Team Avatar's style.,8,1,8
,Asami changes gears and they drive off to patrol the city. The radio begins to speak.,8,1,8
Police dispatcher,"Unit two sixteen, cancel that ten fifty-eight at Harmony Tower. Come back to the station, over. [Cuts off.]",8,1,8
Asami,My dad had police scanners installed in all of his cars. I guess now I know why.,8,1,8
Police dispatcher,"Calling all units, Level Four Alert. Jailbreak at headquarters. Officers down, electrocuted. Chi blockers and Equalist convicts are still at large armed and dangerous. [The team looks at the radio with intent.] Last seen heading east. I repeat, Level Four Alert. Equalist jailbreak! [Asami stops the car as a truck and several Equalist motorcyclists rush through the traffic.]",8,1,8
Bolin,[Shouts.] Chi blockers!,8,1,8
Mako,[Yelling.] That's them! [Camera zooms in quickly.],8,1,8
Korra,[Pointing to her left.] Let's get 'em!,8,1,8
,Asami changes gears and begins the car chase. Cars twirl and stop from crashing into the truck as it plows through the street. Asami dodges the cars and still tails the chi blockers but a massive truck blocks their way.,8,1,8
Asami,Korra! Bolin! Give me a ramp! Now!,8,1,8
,"Korra and Bolin earthbend a massive ramp that sends the car soaring into the air before landing safely, resuming their chase. Mako uses his lightning and strikes one of the chi blocker's motorcycle, making the chi blocker fall to the ground. Bolin earthbends earth darts, hitting the wheel of another motorcycle, causing the chi blocker to fall. Asami dodges the fallen cyclist. The rest of the chi blockers begin to use a smoke screen and move right in front of them. Not being able to see, Asami puts on her goggles and notices the chi blockers turning to the right.",8,1,8
Asami,Help me out! We gotta make this turn!,8,1,8
,"Korra and Bolin earthbend a giant, angled curve, making the car swerve up before landing back onto the street and they resume the chase.",8,1,8
Asami,"They don't know we made the turn. Okay, get ready.",8,1,8
,"Asami changes gears and the car gains speed to ram the motorcyclists, flinging them into the air before landing on top of the bonnet. Mako firebends but his arm is wrapped up by the Equalist's bola. Mako uses his other arm, but it becomes wrapped up as well. The other Equalist jumps in front of Bolin and chi blocks his arm before he can even attack, making him the fall back into his seat with pain. Asami electrocutes the chi blocker with her glove, causing the Equalist to fall onto the back seat. The first Equalist attempts to pull Mako out of his seat, but Korra grabs his shoulders and pulls him down, causing the Equalist to fall over onto the car, where Asami electrocutes him. Mako chucks the unconscious Equalist to the back and prepares to do another lightning strike. Asami drives the car closer to the truck so the driver is visible and Mako shoots his lightning at the driver. The driver becomes unconscious and the truck begins to swerve before tumbling to its sides, hitting the lamp post before it stopped. Photos are taken by reporters as the team waits for the police to arrive. Korra smiles as Tarrlok approaches them.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Sternly.] Avatar Korra, what do you think you are doing?",8,1,8
Korra,"[Mockingly.] Oh, hey Tarrlok. Nice of you to show up finally. Here, we captured the escaped convicts for you.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Angered.] What you did was tear up the city and impede the real authorities in their pursuit of these criminals.,8,1,8
Korra,"[Raises one eyebrow.] Hmm, that's funny. [Places her finger on her cheek.] I didn't see your little task force or the cops the whole time. [Folds her arms and she looks away.] If it wasn't for Team Avatar, [Inspects her fingers.] they would've gotten away.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Points at her in fury.] This is your last warning. Stay out of my way! [He turns back and drives away while Team Avatar smiles in victory.],8,1,8
,Cut to the outside City Hall.,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] Republic City stands as a beacon of freedom, but the Equalists are using that freedom to tear it down. [Changes to show Tarrlok speaking to the council.] The law I have proposed would make it illegal for anyone to be a member of the Equalists or even be associated with them. It also puts into effect a curfew, ensuring all nonbenders are in their own homes by nightfall.",8,1,8
Tenzin,"This is going too far, Tarrlok! [Stands up.] You can't punish all nonbenders for the actions of a few! [Swings his hand on to the side.]",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Shot back.] That kind of cowardice will cause our city to fall into Amon's hands. We must pass this law. All in favor? [The councilmen raise their hands as Tenzin sighs angrily while Tarrlok smiles mischievously.],8,1,8
,"Changes to the streets of Republic City where Team Avatar are resting and eating their dumplings, when the radio suddenly starts buzzing.",8,1,8
Police dispatcher,"All available units, please respond to the fifty six hundred block of Dragon Flats borough. Equalists have taken to the streets, consider them armed and dangerous. Proceed with caution. [Team Avatar moves into the car. Bolin jumps besides Asami.]",8,1,8
Bolin,I call front!,8,1,8
Mako,[Lets Korra go first.] After you.,8,1,8
Korra,"What a gentleman, [Mako helps Korra into the car.] thanks!",8,1,8
,"Both jump into the car, smiling at each other as Asami adjusts the mirrors, narrowing her eyes at them in disdain before starting the car and driving off to the Dragon Flats borough, where police airships are circling around an area plunged in darkness.",8,1,8
Korra,Why is the power out?,8,1,8
,The car swerves around the corner and stops. Asami takes off her goggles as they look at hundreds of nonbenders protesting at the metalbending police officers who are holding them behind a blockade.,8,1,8
Asami,"[Confused.] Wait a second, these people aren't armed or dangerous.",8,1,8
Korra,[Concerned.] Sure doesn't look that way. [They turn to see Saikhan speaking through a microphone.],8,1,8
Saikhan,"All nonbenders, return to your homes immediately.",8,1,8
Male #1,"Yeah, as soon as you turn our power back on. [Cries of protests in agreement began to stir.]",8,1,8
Saikhan,"Disperse, or you will all be arrested.",8,1,8
Female #1,[Holding a child.] You benders can't treat us this way! [Her other child tugs at her skirt and points at Korra.],8,1,8
Child #1,"Mummy, look! It's the Avatar! [People turn around and rush toward Korra.]",8,1,8
Female #1,"[To Korra.] Please, help us! You're our Avatar, too!",8,1,8
Korra,"[Looking at the people in sadness, she strides forward, pushing two metalbender officers aside.] Everyone, please stay calm. I'm gonna put a stop to this. [Turns along with her friends as they search for Tarrlok who is talking to a task force member.] Tarrlok, you need to turn the power back on and leave these people alone.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Sternly.] Avatar Korra, you and your playmates have no business here.",8,1,8
Korra,We're not going anywhere. You don't have the right to treat these innocent people like criminals.,8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Lifts his hand.] This is an Equalist rally. [Points at the people.] There is nothing innocent about it.,8,1,8
Asami,"[Stand up to him.] They're not Equalists, they're just normal people who want their rights back.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Furiously.] They are the enemy! [To the metalbending offices.] Round up all these Equalists!,8,1,8
,"Metalbending officers begin to earthbend, removing the legs from the barriers and forcing the people back as they coil the barriers around them. The metalbenders slam their legs into the ground, causing large mounds of earth to rise underneath the nonbenders, lifting them off the ground. Fear begins to spread through those not caught, and they start running away. The police force prepares to put people into the police trucks, while Team Avatar looks on aghast.",8,1,8
Korra,[Running toward the people.] Stop!,8,1,8
,"Korra earthbends the mounds of earth down so every one can escape. Tarrlok snarls at her, and turns to see Asami watching her. He bends a water whip to grab onto Asami's wrist. Asami turns and looks up at him.",8,1,8
Asami,[Angrily as she struggles to be free.] Hey! Let me go!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Shouting.] You're under arrest!,8,1,8
Mako,[Shocked.] What? [Points at him.] You can't do that!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Asami is grabbed by the task force.] Actually, I can. She's a nonbender out past curfew [Pointing at Asami.] and her father is a known Equalist conspirator.",8,1,8
Mako,[Furiously.] Let her go!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,[To the metalbending officers while pointing at the brothers.] Arrest him and his brother! [The metalbending officers coil their cables around the brothers and pull them in.],8,1,8
Korra,[Shouts angrily.] Tarrlok! [She earthbends two massive rocks on either side of her.],8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Unless you want to join your friends in prison, I suggest you put those down and go back to the Air Temple.",8,1,8
Mako,"Korra, listen to him. It's not worth it. [Korra reluctantly drops the rocks back down.]",8,1,8
Bolin,[As the brothers walk into the police truck.] We'll be all right.,8,1,8
Korra,"[Calling back.] Don't worry, I'll call Tenzin. He can get you out. [Mako walks into the police truck, and looks up at Korra before the doors close on him. Korra looks on in dismay.]",8,1,8
Tarrlok,So sad to see your little Team Avatar broken up. You had a good run.,8,1,8
Korra,"[Pointing at him.] This isn't over, Tarrlok.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Oh, I believe it is. [To the drivers.] Take them away. [Korra looks at the trucks before looking down in regret.]",8,1,8
,"Scene changes to the Police Headquarters, moving down to show Tenzin walking up to the front doors. He walks up toward Korra, who attempts to talk to the person behind the counter without success.",8,1,8
Korra,[Calls out to get that person back.] Hey! [Fists hit the counter.],8,1,8
Tenzin,I came as fast as I could. Are your friends all right?,8,1,8
Korra,[Frustrated.] I don't know! These knuckleheads won't tell me anything.,8,1,8
Tenzin,"[Reassuring her.] I'll take care of this. [Spots Saikhan walking. Saikhan notices Tenzin, and tries to walk away.] Saikhan, a word please.",8,1,8
Saikhan,"[Turns to them.] Councilman Tenzin, I'm pretty swamped at the moment. Can this wait?",8,1,8
Tenzin,"No, it cannot. Three of Avatar Korra's friends were wrongly arrested tonight. I'd like you to release them immediately.",8,1,8
Saikhan,They're not going anywhere. They were interfering with police business.,8,1,8
Korra,"Your so called police business was rounding up innocent people and claiming they were Equalists. They should be released, too.",8,1,8
Saikhan,All Equalists suspects are being detained indefinitely. They'll be freed if and when the task force deems they are no longer a threat.,8,1,8
Tenzin,Those people are entitled to due process under the law.,8,1,8
Saikhan,You'll have to take that up with Councilman Tarrlok.,8,1,8
Tenzin,"[Raises his pointer finger.] Oh, I plan to. At the council meeting, first thing in the morning. [Close-up of Saikhan's narrowing eyes.]",8,1,8
Korra,"[Cut to side-view of Saikhan and Korra, who points at the former.] You're officially the worst Chief of Police ever! [Places her hand to grip his chin, moving his head up and down.]",8,1,8
Tenzin,"[Grabs Korra away.] Calm down, Korra. [Cut to shot of Korra, Tenzin, and Saikhan's back.] I'll get this sorted out, we just need to be patient. [Cut to a side view of all three. Korra and Tenzin turn and start to walk away before Tenzin stops and turns.] But you really are the worst! [As he turns the leave again, he once more quickly turns back and points at Saikhan.] Ever! [Both he and Korra walk away.]",8,1,8
,"Cut to Air Temple Island where it is snowing. Korra lies on her bed, angry at herself and opens the window to look at Republic City. She turns to Naga.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Whispering.] Wake up, Naga. [Squats next to her.] Let's go.",8,1,8
,Scene changes to City Hall. Korra rides on Naga as they come closer to the building. Korra slips down from Naga.,8,1,8
Korra,"[To Naga.] Wait for me here, girl. [Naga moves her head with concern, but Korra rubs her head against hers.] Don't worry, I'll be all right.",8,1,8
,"She walks away. Scene changes to show Tarrlok working with the council page before the window bursts open, blowing papers everywhere. You can see a decorative waterfall behind Tarrlok and the council page. They look up to see Korra standing at the window.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Sternly.] You and I need to talk. [Korra jumps in and walks up to Tarrlok, who's face contorts with anger.]",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[To his assistant while looking at Korra.] Are any of the other council members here?,8,1,8
Council page,I believe everyone has gone home for the night.,8,1,8
Tarrlok,Then you should do the same.,8,1,8
Council page,"[Shifting eyes.] Are you sure, sir?",8,1,8
Tarrlok,Leave us. [The council page looks at Korra before looking back at Tarrlok. He bows and quickly walks away.] You obviously have something on your mind? Spit it out.,8,1,8
Korra,Don't you see? You're doing exactly what Amon says is wrong with benders. You're using your power to oppress and intimidate people!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Tilts his head to the side.] And you don't?,8,1,8
Korra,[Taken aback.] Of- [Determined.] Of course not!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Isn't that what you came here to do? Intimidate me into releasing your friends. [Korra glares at him.] See, that's what I admire about you, Korra. Your willingness to go to extremes in order to get what you want. It is a quality we both share.",8,1,8
Korra,[Angrily.] You and I are nothing alike!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Look, I'll make you a deal. You fall in line and do what I say and I'll release your friends.",8,1,8
Korra,[Shocked.] That's why you arrested them? To get to me?,8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Close-up of Tarrlok creasing his brows.] I need your answer.,8,1,8
Korra,"[Short pause; seriously.] No. You might be able to manipulate Chief Saikhan into following you, but it won't work on me.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,[Stands up and turns his back; angrily.] You will regret that decision.,8,1,8
Korra,You need to be stopped! [Pointing at him accusingly.] You're just as bad as Amon!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"[Eyes widen in rage.] I've tried to work with you, Korra, but you've made it impossible.",8,1,8
,"Tarrlok turns around, suddenly slicing a stream of water from the waterfall at her. Korra barely dodges, only a small section of her hair being cut. She rolls and earthbends at Tarrlok, forcing him back and causing him to hit his back on the wall. Korra raises her arms and holds it straight while shooting a blast of fire toward Tarrlok, who protects himself by waterbending a dome around him. He thrusts his hands forward repeatedly behind the dome, firing several ice darts toward Korra, who flips back to try and dodge them, but still gets grazed as she lands. She attempts to punch the ice darts away, but one catches her on her side, and she lifts her hands up to protect her head. Tarrlok continues to throw ice darts at her with a sadistic smile, but Korra earthbends a wall to protect herself. She thrusts her arm forward, earthbending the wall behind Tarrlok into him, causing him to fly through the wall into the council chambers. He tries to right himself, but trips over the railing and begins to fall, grabbing the railing with his hand, his hair loose over his face as he glares.",8,1,8
Korra,[Walking through the hole in the hall.] Still think that I'm a half-baked Avatar?,8,1,8
,"She earthbends, causing Tarrlok to fall to the ground. She jumps off and punches the ground, causing a gigantic hole around her. She looks up at him with anger, breathing heavily.",8,1,8
Korra,"What are you gonna do now? You're all out of water, pal.",8,1,8
,"Tarrlok moves away in fear as Korra begins to firebend from her palms. She runs toward him intending to vaporize him, but she is halted by Tarrlok as he begins to perform bloodbending. Korra groans in pain as he continues, making her fall to her knees.",8,1,8
Tarrlok,"You're in my way Avatar, and you need to be removed.",8,1,8
Korra,"[Looks at her arms before looking at Tarrlok with shock, as he continues.] You're, you're a bloodbender?",8,1,8
Tarrlok,Very observant.,8,1,8
Korra,[Continues to struggle.] It's not a full moon! [He continues to bloodbend.] How- how are you doing this?!,8,1,8
Tarrlok,There are a lot of things you don't know about me.,8,1,8
,"Tarrlok bloodbends her and flings her across the room into a pillar. Korra begins to lose consciousness as Tarrlok approaches her, until she faints. Visions come to where in a courtroom, Yakone bulges his eyes in pain, Sokka yells in pain from the bloodbending. Toph tries to metalbend her cables, but she too is bloodbent. Aang struggles to move closer to Yakone, who laughs at him, an expression of determination in his eyes. Korra sluggishly wakes up to find Tarrlok has binded her with ropes. She lifts up her head.",8,1,8
Korra,Where are you taking me?,8,1,8
Tarrlok,"Somewhere no one will find you. [Korra's expression shows fury to him.] Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again! [Begins to close the doors as Korra firebends a breath of fire from her mouth, screaming in anger. Tarrlok manages to close it in time and slams a fist on the door before walking up to start driving.]",8,1,8
Korra,[Screaming.] You can't do this! [Tarrlok starts driving.] Let me out! [Car begins to move.] Garh!,8,1,8
,The car drives away from the City Hall as the camera pans up to show a crescent moon. Cut to credits.,8,1,8
,"The episode opens by showing a basement room with a metal box in the center and a dark staircase are also seen. A door at the top of the stairs opens and Tarrlok steps in, using bloodbending to levitate Korra several inches off the ground in front of him. Korra groans as he levitates her down the stairs and into the box.",9,1,9
Korra,"[Strained, while looking at Tarrlok.] What are you doing? [When Korra is entirely in the box, he releases his bloodbending grip on her, causing her to land, and slams the metal door shut; aggressively.] Tarrlok! [Korra begins pounding on the door as Tarrlok walks up the stairs.] You can't keep me in here forever!",9,1,9
,"Tarrlok steps outside and gets back into his vehicle. He drives away, revealing that Korra's prison is in a remote location in the middle of snowy mountains. Cut to Air Temple Island at dawn as a telephone rings. Tenzin and Pema are asleep in bed with Meelo between them. Meelo sits up, rubs his eyes, and crawls over his father's face to answer the phone, waking him up in the process.",9,1,9
Meelo,[Annoyed.] Who is this? It's six in the morning! This better be important!,9,1,9
Tenzin,"[Sitting up and taking the phone from him, leaving him somewhat annoyed.] Councilman Tenzin here. [Camera rotates around him to show his shock at the news he just received.] What?!",9,1,9
,"Cut to a photographer taking a photo of the damages in City Hall. Tenzin arrives, while the camera, through the lens of a photo camera, zooms in on an electrified glove and several Equalists weapons. Cut to Tarrlok, who is having his arm wound healed by a male healer.",9,1,9
Tenzin,What happened? [Walks toward Tarrlok.] What was Korra doing at City Hall?,9,1,9
Tarrlok,"As I told Chief Saikhan, [Stands up as he rolls down his sleeve.] Korra came to my office late last night. She was upset that I arrested her friends. She asked me to release them and ... that's when the Equalists attacked. [Flashback to Tarrlok dropping an Equalist chi blocker mask.] I tried to protect Korra, but we were outnumbered. [Flashback of Tarrlok throwing a bola around a pillar.] Then, I was electrocuted. [Flashback of Tarrlok, as he uses an Equalist glove to electrify himself in the shoulder while growling.] When I came to, the police had arrived. But Korra was gone. [Moves toward Tenzin; sighs regretfully.] I'm so sorry. [Bows and turns to Saikhan.] Chief Saikhan, mobilize the entire police force. We have to find the Avatar.",9,1,9
,"Cut to Lin Beifong lying in bed, listening to the radio.",9,1,9
Radio,"[Static burst.] We interrupt your regularly scheduled broadcast to bring you this special report. Late last night, Equalists attacked City Hall, [Lin sits upright, startled, and begins tuning the radio to listen more closely.] subduing Councilman Tarrlok and capturing Avatar Korra. Details are still coming in, b-",9,1,9
,"Lin switches off the radio. She gets slowly out of bed, pausing for a moment to groan and hold her arm. She crosses to a cupboard and opens it, looking at her Metalbending Police uniform arranged inside. She stands in her underclothes with her back to the cupboard and metalbends her uniform onto her body. She glances down at the police insignia on her chest and tears it off, before putting on a long coat. Cut to the Toph statue in front of police headquarters, before cutting to Asami lying on her back on a cot in her cell. She sits up as Lin metalbends the door off its hinges and tosses it away.",9,1,9
Lin,"Hope you got enough beauty rest. Come on, I'm busting you out.",9,1,9
Asami,[Smiling.] Thanks. I owe you.,9,1,9
,"Cut to close-up on Bolin's face. Mako and Bolin are standing in their cell. Mako has his back to Bolin, who is attempting to pee in a toilet in the corner of the room.",9,1,9
Mako,Are you done yet?,9,1,9
Bolin,Cover your ears! I can't go with you listening.,9,1,9
,Mako sighs and covers his ears. He glances up as the cell door is metalbent off its hinges.,9,1,9
Mako,Asami! [The two embrace and kiss.],9,1,9
Bolin,"Ahh! [Bolin blushes.] A little privacy, please!",9,1,9
Mako,[To Asami.] Are you all right?,9,1,9
Asami,I'm fine! It's so good to see you.,9,1,9
Lin,"Hate to break up your lovers' reunion, but Korra's in trouble. Amon captured her.",9,1,9
Mako,"[Camera zooms in on Mako, as they look at her in horror.] No. No, she can't be gone!",9,1,9
Lin,"Come on, we have an Avatar to rescue.",9,1,9
,"The three teens run from inside the cell. There is a zipping noise and Bolin stops, squeaks, and blushes.",9,1,9
Lin,[Cut back to Lin as she turns her head outward; her expression indifferent; bluntly.] Your fly was down.,9,1,9
Bolin,[Embarrassed.] Thanks for catching that.,9,1,9
,"Shot of Korra's mountain prison, before cutting to the box in the basement. Korra is throwing herself against the sides of the box, kicking, and pounding trying to break herself out by sheer force.",9,1,9
Korra,"[Pounding on the door.] Somebody! Help! Please! [She slumps to the ground, exhausted and realizing the futility of her actions.] Please. [Tenzin's voice is heard in Korra's memory.]",9,1,9
Tenzin,I urge you to meditate on these visions. I believe Aang's spirit is trying to tell you something.,9,1,9
,Korra inhales and assumes a meditative pose. Flashback of Aang's experiences. He is standing in a street and turns around as he hears multiple booted footsteps behind him.,9,1,9
Toph,"[Voice-over; mildly annoyed.] What are you doing here, Aang? [Cut to Toph and several metalbending police officers.] I told you, I have this under control.",9,1,9
Aang,"[Cut to a concerned Aang.] Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we're not dealing with a normal criminal.",9,1,9
Toph,"[Smiling.] Fine. Follow me, Twinkle Toes.",9,1,9
Aang,"[Annoyed.] Toph, I'm forty years old. You think you could stop with the nicknames?",9,1,9
Toph,[Walking away and still smiling.] 'Fraid not. [Aang grimaces in annoyance and follows.],9,1,9
,"Cut to an aerial shot as the group approaches a table in Kwong's Cuisine, where a man is eating.",9,1,9
Toph,"[Pointing at the man at the table.] It's over! You're under arrest, Yakone!",9,1,9
Yakone,"[Cut to a close-up of Yakone with his eyes closed and head down; calmly.] What is Republic City coming to? Used to be, a man could enjoy his lunch in peace. [Toph bends a cable from a spool at her belt around his wrist and yanks him forward, knocking over his table. A policeman comes to tie his arms behind him.] What's the big idea?",9,1,9
Aang,"We have dozens of witnesses, Yakone. We know what you are.",9,1,9
Toph,[Gestures to guards.] Take him away.,9,1,9
Yakone,"[Being led away; yelling back to Aang and Toph.] I've beaten every trumped-up charge you yahoos have brought against me! [Confidently and arrogantly.] And I'll beat this one, too.",9,1,9
,"Close-up on Aang's serious face, which changes to Korra's face as the flashback ends.",9,1,9
Korra,"[Eyes open wide.] Whoa. [To the ceiling.] I finally connected with you, Aang. [Confused.] But, what are you trying to tell me? [With a sad expression.] A way out of this box would be nice. [She inhales, closes her eyes and begins meditating again.]",9,1,9
,"Cut to Lin, Mako, Bolin, and Asami walking into Tenzin's office. Tenzin is on the phone.",9,1,9
Tenzin,[Over phone.] I have to go. Call me back the minute you hear anything. [Hangs up and stands up; very surprised.] Lin? Wh-wh-what are y- What are y- You should be in the hospital! And you three! [Points.] You should be in prison!,9,1,9
Lin,I figured you could use our help finding Korra.,9,1,9
Mako,[Steps forward anxiously.] Do you have any leads?,9,1,9
Tenzin,"I've been on the phone all morning, but nothing yet.",9,1,9
Mako,[Excitedly with a new idea.] We need Naga! She can track Korra.,9,1,9
Tenzin,I'm afraid her polar bear dog is missing as well.,9,1,9
Bolin,Then where do we start?,9,1,9
Lin,My guess is the Equalists are hiding underground in the maze of tunnels beneath the city.,9,1,9
Asami,[Bitterly.] Underground ... just like my father's secret factory. Figures.,9,1,9
Bolin,"[Remembering a past experience.] Yeah! Yeah, that makes sense! When those chi blockers had me in their truck, it sounded like we drove into a tunnel!",9,1,9
Mako,"I know where to start looking! Come on! [He, Bolin, and Asami rush from the room.]",9,1,9
Lin,"[To Tenzin.] Wherever Amon is keeping Korra, I bet that's where my officers are too.",9,1,9
Tenzin,"Let's bring them all home, Lin.",9,1,9
,"Cut to shot of downtown Republic City, as the group flies in on Oogi. They land in a deserted street and dismount off Oogi.",9,1,9
Mako,[Points down a road.] The truck with Bolin took off down this alley. [The group jogs to the next intersection.],9,1,9
Asami,Which way?,9,1,9
Bolin,Hmm. This way kinda ... [Sniffs the air.] smells familiar.,9,1,9
,Lin metalbends the sole of her shoe back and uses seismic sense to test the ground.,9,1,9
Lin,There's a tunnel nearby. [Sets off as the rest of the group follows and slides down an embankment.],9,1,9
Mako,[Indicating a large tunnel entrance with a metal gate.] There!,9,1,9
Lin,[Inspecting the ground.] Motorcycle tracks.,9,1,9
Mako,Korra has to be in there ... somewhere.,9,1,9
,Lin metalbends the gate open. Cut to the group walking into an intersection of tunnels. Mako uses firebending to light the way.,9,1,9
Mako,Let's try this way.,9,1,9
Asami,And what if Korra's not down there?,9,1,9
Mako,[Sharply.] Then we pick another tunnel until we find her! [Asami looks hurt.],9,1,9
,"Cut to the group walking down the tunnel. Asami has dropped back, placing herself so that she is next to Bolin.",9,1,9
Asami,"Hey, is Mako all right? He seems really worried about Korra.",9,1,9
Bolin,"[Agreeing.] Yeah, we all are!",9,1,9
Asami,"I know, but, he's your brother. Do you think that he likes Korra as more than just a friend?",9,1,9
Bolin,"[In a slightly high-pitched voice and chuckling nervously.] W-What? No! That's, just gossip, where'd you hear that? [Pointing to Asami.] Crazy talk is coming out of your mouth right now. Heh ...",9,1,9
Asami,"[Placing her hand on his shoulder; in a demanding tone.] What do you know, Bolin? Come on, spill it.",9,1,9
Bolin,"Nothing! I mean, there was this one time during the tournament when Mako and Korra kissed, but-",9,1,9
Asami,[In shock.] They ... kissed? [Looks at Mako's back.],9,1,9
Bolin,"Believe me, I was upset too, but, I'm over it. I don't think it meant anything.",9,1,9
Asami,[Upset.] I doubt that. [Starts walking after the others when the noise of motorcycles is heard.],9,1,9
Lin,Hide!,9,1,9
,"The five duck behind a pillar as the Equalist motorcycles approach. One Equalist flips a switch on his motorcycle dash that in turn opens a secret door in the opposite wall of the tunnel. The two motorcycles race inside and the door promptly closes. Lin makes a face and crosses the tunnel, followed by the others. She runs her hand across the door and uses metalbending to trigger the opening mechanism and force the door up. The group rushes in and the door closes behind them. They approach a large open space, where Equalists are loading supplies onto tram carts on tracks that lead into various tunnels. An Equalist with a clipboard is directing loading and traffic.",9,1,9
Equalist traffic director,That tram goes to the training camp. [Tram disappears down a tunnel and he walks to another one that has just arrived. A female Equalist climbs down.],9,1,9
Female Equalist,"Everything was delivered to the prison, sir. [Both walk away.]",9,1,9
Tenzin,[Whispering to the others.] That's where they must be keeping Korra.,9,1,9
Lin,We need to get down that tunnel.,9,1,9
,"Lin signals the group with her hand and they all run toward the tram and jump in. The tram starts to move down the tunnel. At the tunnel's exit, two Equalists are waiting for the tram. A light flashes and an alarm sounds to signal the tram's arrival. It coasts to a stop with nothing inside.",9,1,9
Equalist,It's empty!,9,1,9
Equalist,"[Sarcastically.] Yeah, I can see that.",9,1,9
,"From inside the tunnel, Lin uses her metalbending cables to grab the two Equalists and drag them inside. The two Equalists are shown tied up next to each other.",9,1,9
Lin,"[To Bolin and Asami.] You two, keep an eye on them.",9,1,9
,Lin uses her seismic sense to search the prison.,9,1,9
Lin,My officers are inside.,9,1,9
Mako,[Curiously.] What about Korra?,9,1,9
Lin,I don't see her yet.,9,1,9
,"Mako, Lin, and Tenzin head off down the corridor. They turn the corner and see two Equalists, who prepare to attack them. Tenzin uses his airbending to knock them against a wall. Mako runs toward them and grabs one of them, removing his mask.",9,1,9
Mako,[Angrily.] Avatar Korra. Where are you keeping her?,9,1,9
,"Cut to Lin peering into the prison cell, where her metalbending officers are being kept. She metalbends the bars apart and walks in.",9,1,9
Officer,[Wearily.] Chief Beifong?,9,1,9
Lin,"I'm too late. That monster already took your bending, didn't he?",9,1,9
,The officer nods his head. Lin looks down sadly.,9,1,9
Lin,"[Sadly.] I'm so sorry. [In a normal tone.] Come on, let's gets you out of here.",9,1,9
,"All the officers get up and follow Lin out of the cell. Cut to Mako, who has pinned the Equalist against a wall.",9,1,9
Mako,[Angrily.] I'll ask you one more time; [Ignites his right hand.] where is she?,9,1,9
Equalist,"[Weakly while grabbing Mako's arm.] We don't have the Avatar, and the Equalists didn't attack City Hall. Tarrlok's lying.",9,1,9
Mako,[Drops the man back to the ground; surprised.] What?,9,1,9
,Lin walks up.,9,1,9
Lin,I scanned the entire prison. Korra's not here.,9,1,9
Mako,"[Letting go of the man, who collapses while dispersing the flame in his hand.] Why would Tarrlok make up a story about getting attacked?",9,1,9
Tenzin,Because he has Korra. He fooled us all!,9,1,9
,A siren starts sounds and the group runs back to where Bolin and Asami are standing guard.,9,1,9
Bolin,"Let's go, people!",9,1,9
,"Everyone gets into the tram, which takes off. Equalists in another tram start to catch up from behind. Bolin uses his earthbending to collapse the tunnel sides, causing the tram to crash in the rubble.",9,1,9
Bolin,"[Jubilantly and challengingly.] Try to chi block that, fools!",9,1,9
,"Lin, at the front of the tram, notices an army of Equalists waiting up ahead. Among them is the Lieutenant and several mecha tanks.",9,1,9
Lin,We've got more company! [Lin metalbends a rail from the ceiling onto the track.] Hang on!,9,1,9
,"The tram climbs the rail as Lin earthbends a hole in the ceiling. The tram flies through the gap and lands on the ground of the tunnel above. Everyone groans as Lin makes another hole on the ceiling and daylight streams in. Cut to the mountains, where Tarrlok is keeping Korra. Cut to Korra meditating in the metal box. Flashback to Aang's memory of Yakone's trial.",9,1,9
Prosecution attorney,"Yakone has ruled Republic City's criminal empire for years. Yet he has always managed to stay out of the law's reach, until now. You will hear testimony, from dozens of his victims, and they will tell you, Yakone has maintained his grip on the underworld by using an ability that has been illegal for decades. [Turns to the council, where an older Sokka is sitting.] Bloodbending. [Sokka narrows his eyes.]",9,1,9
Defense attorney,"The prosecution's entire case is built upon the make-believe notion that my client is able to bloodbend at will, at any time on any day. I remind the council that bloodbending is an incredibly rare skill and it can only be performed during a full moon. [Close-up of Yakone.] Yet, the witnesses will claim that my client used bloodbending at every other time except during a full moon. It would be a mockery of justice to convict a man of a crime that is impossible to commit.",9,1,9
,"Cut to Aang before cutting back to Korra, who continues to meditate. Cut back to flashback as the United Republic Council returns from their deliberations and takes their seats.",9,1,9
Bailiff,Councilman Sokka will now deliver the verdict.,9,1,9
Sokka,"In my years, I have encountered people born with rare and unique bending abilities. Why, I once bested a man with my trusty boomerang who was able to firebend with his mind. [Looks at Toph.] Why, even metalbending was considered impossible for all of history until our esteemed Chief of Police, [Camera cuts to Toph and her metalbending cops.] Toph Beifong, singlehandedly developed the skill. The overwhelming amount of testimony and evidence has convinced this council that Yakone is one of these unique benders and he exploited his ability to commit these heinous crimes. We find Yakone guilty of all charges and sentence him to life in prison.",9,1,9
,"Sokka pounds his gavel to seal the decision. The defense attorney crumples up a paper, throws it, and slams his fist on the table in annoyance. He looks toward his client as Yakone slowly stands up, grinning. Close-up of Yakone, as his eyes begin to suddenly bulge. Sokka cries out in pain as his body is contorted and after a moment, the other councilmen cry out as well. Cut to Toph Beifong, who is briefly shocked before trying to stop Yakone by metalbending her cables at him. Yakone rolls his eyes at her, incapacitating her immediately. He laughs as he turns and sees the entire room under his control. Aang struggles as he reaches out his hand to Yakone. Cut to Korra breathing deeply and raggedly with her eyes closed. Cut to City Hall, followed by the council chamber, as Tenzin's group approaches the council members and Chief Saikhan.",9,1,9
Tenzin,Thank you all for meeting us on such short notice.,9,1,9
Lin,[To Saikhan; coldly.] Chief.,9,1,9
Saikhan,[Just as coldly.] Lin.,9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Approaches from behind.] Have you news of Avatar Korra?,9,1,9
Tenzin,"We do. [Points at Tarrlok; angrily.] You kidnapped her, Tarrlok!",9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Innocently.] I am shocked you would accuse me of such an evil act! I already explained: Equalists attacked us and took her!,9,1,9
Tenzin,"But there were no chi blockers here last night. [Pointing.] You planted the evidence, didn't you?",9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Angrily.] That is a ridiculous accusation!,9,1,9
Council page,"[From behind a pillar on the balcony above.] It's true! He took her! I was here when Avatar Korra arrived last night, but Councilman Tarrlok ordered me to leave. I was on my way out when I saw Tarrlok bring her down to the garage.",9,1,9
,"Flashback to Tarrlok kidnapping Korra, throwing her into the back of his automobile.",9,1,9
Tarrlok,"Say goodbye to Republic City, Avatar Korra. You'll never see it again.",9,1,9
,"Tarrlok leaps back and shields himself from a burst of flame, slamming the door as Korra screams in frustration. The page watches from behind a pillar as Tarrlok drives off. End of flashback.",9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Enraged.] That is nonsense! [Page cowers behind the pillar as he points at him.] Everyone knows you're nothing but a squeaky-voiced liar!,9,1,9
Lin,[Folds her arms and looks at the page.] Why did you wait until now to 'fess up?,9,1,9
Council page,[Looking down.] I was terrified to tell because ... [Looks up.] Because Tarrlok is a bloodbender! [Everyone looks at Tarrlok in shock.] He bloodbent Avatar Korra!,9,1,9
Tenzin,[To Tarrlok.] Don't make this worse for yourself. [Takes his airbending stance.] Tell us where you have Korra.,9,1,9
,"Lin also takes her stance and both prepare to attack. Tarrlok's eyes bulge as Tenzin and Lin both bend at him, but he has control of their bodies before they can hit him. Everyone in the room cries out in pain as Tarrlok bloodbends them to their knees. Tarrlok continues to bloodbend until one by one, everyone falls unconscious. Tarrlok backs away and flees the scene. Cut to an unconscious Tenzin as Lin walks up to him.",9,1,9
Lin,Wake up!,9,1,9
,"Lin slaps Tenzin across the face, waking him fully. Mako helps Asami up as Bolin wakes up and moves around.",9,1,9
Bolin,[Looks around the chamber.] Ughh! Man! I had this awful dream that Korra was taken by this evil bloodbender. [Mako and Asami look at him.] So weird.,9,1,9
Asami,"Bolin, that really happened. He knocked us out.",9,1,9
Bolin,[Shocked.] Are you serious? [Looks around.] Where is he? Is he here right now?,9,1,9
Saikhan,Tarrlok is long gone. I'll alert the whole force. [He and the council members leave.],9,1,9
Lin,We've only been out for a little while. Maybe we can still pick up Tarrlok's trail.,9,1,9
Tenzin,It could lead us to Korra! Let's go. [Everyone runs off.],9,1,9
,"Cut to Korra meditating in the box. Flashback into Aang's memories. Aang is being bloodbent by Yakone, who is grinning in relish at his own power. Cut to Sokka's face, followed by Toph's, as Yakone makes her grab a ring of keys from her deputy's belt and float over to him. He forces Toph to unlock his cuffs, which bounce to the ground. He flexes his wrists, and raises his hands to bloodbend everyone into unconsciousness. He turns to see that Aang is still awake and levitates him high into the air.",9,1,9
Aang,[With difficulty.] Yakone. [Yakone bloodbends his arms behind his back.] You won't get away with this!,9,1,9
Yakone,"[Laughing.] Republic City's mine, Avatar. I'll be back one day to claim it.",9,1,9
,"Yakone bloodbends Aang into the steps of the dais, knocking him out, before running outside. He leaps into a cart pulled by an ostrich horse and dashes off. Meanwhile, Aang regains consciousness as his eyes and tattoos glow briefly. He bursts out of City Hall on a large air scooter and quickly catches Yakone, who looks up and gasps. Aang sends a blade of wind to sever the ostrich horse's harness from the cart, which flips onto its side and slides to a halt. Aang coasts in front of the cart and waits for a moment. Yakone bursts out of the side door and bloodbends him to the ground.",9,1,9
Yakone,This time I'm gonna put you to sleep for good!,9,1,9
,"Aang groans in pain as Yakone levitates him into the air and begins contorting his body to painful and near death positions. Suddenly, his eyes and tattoos glow once again and the bloodbending immediately has no effect on him. He earthbends a cone of rock around Yakone's body, immobilizing him completely, and places his thumbs on Yakone's forehead and chest as he struggles.",9,1,9
Aang,"I'm taking away your bending, for good. [Yakone groans as Aang's tattoos and eyes lit up as he energybends Yakone to remove his waterbending. When Aang's tattoos stop glowing, he steps back and Yakone slumps down. Frontal shot; in a somewhat tired tone.] It's over.",9,1,9
Korra,[Stops meditating.] Aang ... this whole time ... you were trying to warn me about Tarrlok. [Rubs her eyes and stands up as she hears the door open.],9,1,9
Tarrlok,"[Furiously.] My life is a disaster now, thanks to you.",9,1,9
Korra,So your little bloodbending secret's out? [Tarrlok growls at her before leaving.] And I know how you bloodbent me without a full moon. [Tarrlok stops walking.] You're Yakone's son.,9,1,9
Tarrlok,"[Correcting her.] I was his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else. My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly. My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior. But you, you ruined everything!",9,1,9
Korra,"Tarrlok, the jig is up and you have nowhere to go.",9,1,9
Tarrlok,"Oh no. No, I'll escape and start a new life. And you're coming as my hostage.",9,1,9
Korra,[Pounding on the door of the box.] You'll never get away with this!,9,1,9
,"Tarrlok walks to the top of the steps and gasps when he sees Amon, the Lieutenant, and several chi blockers waiting for him.",9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Shocked.] Amon!,9,1,9
,"Cut to Korra in her box, who gasps.",9,1,9
Amon,It is time for you to be equalized. [The Lieutenant and other Equalists behind him all take fighting stances.],9,1,9
Tarrlok,You fool! You've never faced bending like mine.,9,1,9
,"Tarrlok begins bloodbending the group. The other Equalists all crumple and fall to the ground, but Amon seems unaffected and with minor struggle, begins walking forward. Tarrlok gasps and redoubles his efforts. Amon is halted for a moment, but with a very great effort he moves one foot forward and continues walking normally. Tarrlok begins backing up in horror.",9,1,9
Tarrlok,[Whispers in surprise and horror.] What? What are you?,9,1,9
Amon,I am the solution.,9,1,9
,"Amon reaches out and grabs Tarrlok's arm, twisting him around until he is standing behind him. He jabs his right hand at the base of Tarrlok's neck, who groans at that, and moves his left hand toward his forehead as Tarrlok watches in horror. Cut to Korra sitting in her box, who hears Tarrlok's scream of anguish as his bending is removed. She looks up toward the ceiling, and the camera pans up a floor as he collapses to the ground with wide open eyes. The Equalists all groan and stand up as Amon lifts Tarrlok's limp body onto his shoulders.",9,1,9
Amon,I'll take care of him. You four retrieve the Avatar. Do not underestimate her. Electrocute the box to knock her out before you open it. [Korra's eyes widen as she hears this.],9,1,9
Lieutenant,My pleasure.,9,1,9
,Korra gazes at the bars in the top of the box as she hears the Equalists' footsteps descending the stairs. She glances down and fingers one of the bands on her forearm.,9,1,9
Lieutenant,[Stepping in front of the box and pulling out his electrified kali sticks.] It's payback time. [Shocks the box.],9,1,9
,"From inside, Korra fakes cries of pain as electricity courses through the box. She has removed one of her armbands and wrapped it over a bar in the roof. She is hanging from it so that she is insulated from the electricity and not harmed. The hanging bulb above the box shatters and the Lieutenant steps back.",9,1,9
Lieutenant,[To the chi blockers.] Open the box. [A chi blocker opens the door to find Korra lying motionless on the floor.] Tie her up.,9,1,9
,"Korra firebends a large burst of flame from her foot, forcing the Equalists back as she leaps out of the box. The Equalists fling their bolas at her, but she dodges and earthbends a giant wave to send them flying. Cut to Amon putting Tarrlok in his truck, as Korra bursts out of the house. They lock eyes for a moment before Korra bends snow into spears of ice and hurls them at Amon. He dodges, giving her enough time to run away and jump off a steep slope of the mountain. The Equalists run up to Amon.",9,1,9
Amon,[To the Lieutenant and the three other Equalists; calmly scolding.] I thought I told you not to underestimate her.,9,1,9
,"Korra looks behind, as she uses waterbending to snowboard down the mountain. She trips over a tree root and flies into the air, landing hard against a tree. Snow lands on her and she groans before losing consciousness. Sometime later, Naga appears and runs up to Korra. She licks Korra's face, waking her up.",9,1,9
Korra,Naga. You came looking for me. [Naga continues licking her.] Good girl.,9,1,9
,"She hugs Naga. Cut to Korra lying slumped across Naga's back as they walk back to Republic City. Cut to Tenzin, Lin, Mako, Bolin, and Asami flying above the city on Oogi as they hear a howl.",9,1,9
Mako,That sounds like Naga! [Tenzin pulls the bison into a turn.] Down there!,9,1,9
,Korra moans slightly as the bison lands and the group dismounts. Tenzin and Lin run up to her.,9,1,9
Tenzin,"Korra! Oh, thank goodness.",9,1,9
Lin,Where's Tarrlok? How did you get away?,9,1,9
Mako,[Shoving Lin and Tenzin aside.] Give her some space! [He reaches up and pulls Korra into his arms as he begins walking toward Oogi. Asami looks on with a pained expression.] I was so worried. Are you all right?,9,1,9
Korra,I'm fine. I'm glad you're here. [Closes her eyes and leans her head against Mako's chest.],9,1,9
,"Mako carries Korra to the bison's saddle and sets her gently down, brushing her hair back from her face.",9,1,9
Mako,[Gently.] You're safe now.,9,1,9
,Korra looks at him before falling asleep. Cut to everyone standing in the street.,9,1,9
,Fades to credits.,9,1,9
,"Naga and Pabu are seen curled up in a courtyard on Air Temple Island. Cut to a shot of Korra lying asleep in bed with her hair all undone, as Mako watches over her. He holds her hand, while Asami watches silently from a doorway. She looks down sadly and leaves. Cut to Tenzin entering his room, where his wife and children are all sleeping in one bed. He sits next to the bed and places his hand on Pema's stomach, as both she and Jinora open their eyes.",10,1,10
Jinora,"[Sits up in bed.] Daddy, you're home. We waited up for you. Is Korra okay?",10,1,10
Tenzin,"Yes, she's fine, sweetie. [Picks up Ikki as she wakes up, and embraces her.]",10,1,10
Ikki,I was scared. I thought she wasn't coming back.,10,1,10
Tenzin,"[Fatherly.] I'm sorry you were scared, but everything is going to be fine now. I promise.",10,1,10
,"In the dining hall at Air Temple Island, Korra chows down on food while sitting at a table with Bolin, Mako, Asami, Tenzin, Lin, and Pema.",10,1,10
Korra,"Mmm. Mmm. The food tastes amazing, Pema. I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.",10,1,10
Pema,[While standing up to retrieve Korra's cleaned plate.] We're so thankful you're home safe.,10,1,10
Asami,[Standing up to assist Pema.] Let me help.,10,1,10
Tenzin,"Korra, I realize you've been through a lot, but I need to know everything that happened.",10,1,10
Korra,"Well, first off, Tarrlok isn't who he says he is. He's Yakone's son. [Tenzin and Lin appear shocked.]",10,1,10
Lin,It all makes sense now. That's how Tarrlok was able to bloodbend us without a full moon.,10,1,10
Tenzin,But how did you escape? And where's Tarrlok?,10,1,10
Korra,"Amon captured him, [Close-up of her serious face.] and took his bending.",10,1,10
Tenzin,[Shocked.] What?,10,1,10
Korra,"Yeah, he showed up out of nowhere. He almost got me, too.",10,1,10
Tenzin,"This is very disturbing news. Amon is becoming emboldened. Taking out a councilman, almost capturing the Avatar ... I fear Amon is entering his endgame.",10,1,10
,"Bolin, Korra and Mako exchange glances of concern. Cut to Asami and Pema washing dishes in the kitchen. Pema suddenly doubles over and cries out in pain.",10,1,10
Asami,"[Grabbing Pema's shoulder in concern.] Pema, are you all right?",10,1,10
Pema,"The baby is ... just kicking, really hard, is all. I'm fine.",10,1,10
Asami,[Close-up of her concerned face.] Should I get Tenzin?,10,1,10
Pema,"No reason to worry him, it's nothing.",10,1,10
,Mako walks into the kitchen carrying a teapot.,10,1,10
Mako,Can I get some hot water? Korra needs more tea.,10,1,10
Asami,[Angrily.] You're a firebender. Boil it yourself.,10,1,10
,Asami continues washing her dish as both Mako and Pema stare at her with confusion.,10,1,10
Pema,[Brightly.] I'm- gonna step out in case you two want to talk. [Grimaces as she leaves.],10,1,10
Mako,[Confusedly.] Is there something we need to talk about?,10,1,10
Asami,"I've noticed how you treat Korra. How you acted when she was missing. [Drops dish and washcloth in the sink and turns to face him.] You have feelings for her, don't you?",10,1,10
Mako,[Defensively.] What? No! She was taken by a crazy bloodbender! How did you expect me to act?,10,1,10
Asami,[Puts her hand to her chest.] I like Korra. [Moves it away from her chest and turns away slightly.] But you've been keeping the truth from me this whole time.,10,1,10
Mako,[Confusedly.] The truth? About what?,10,1,10
Asami,[Angrily.] You're really going to make me say it?,10,1,10
Mako,Yes! Because I don't know what you're talking about!,10,1,10
Asami,"The kiss, Mako. [Close-up of her face.] I know.",10,1,10
Mako,"[Shocked.] I- Well I- [Sighs; angrily.] Bolin told you, didn't he?!",10,1,10
Asami,[Just as angrily.] Don't blame your brother for what you did. Do you have feelings for Korra or not?,10,1,10
Mako,"Look, things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later? [Places his hand on hers.]",10,1,10
Asami,[Yanking her hand away; somewhat coldly.] Well there might not be any relationship to worry about later. [Marches out of the kitchen.],10,1,10
Mako,Asami! [Groans in frustration.],10,1,10
,"Cut to Tenzin walking through a courtyard, as Lin comes up from behind.",10,1,10
Tenzin,"Lin, um, I, I- I need to ask you a favor. It would mean the world to me ... but I-I know it could be a- a potentially awkward situation; furthermore, - [Lin interrupts.]",10,1,10
Lin,Spit it out already!,10,1,10
Tenzin,"Will you stay here and watch over Pema and the children while I meet with the council? With everything that has happened lately, I want to be sure my family is in safe hands.",10,1,10
Lin,"[Puts her hand on Tenzin's shoulder.] Of course I'll help, old friend.",10,1,10
,"Pema walks up, holding Meelo.",10,1,10
Pema,[With suspicion.] I didn't realize you two were out here.,10,1,10
Tenzin,"Pema! Ye- yes- yes, Lin has agreed to help out around here and keep an eye on things while I'm away.",10,1,10
Pema,Thank you! I could use the extra pair of hands. [Gives a laughing Meelo to Lin.] Would you mind giving him a bath? He's filthy.,10,1,10
,"Meelo sticks out his tongue and blows a raspberry at Lin, while continuing to laugh.",10,1,10
Lin,[As Tenzin mounts his sky bison; yelling out to Tenzin angrily while holding Meelo away from herself.] This is not what I signed on for!,10,1,10
Tenzin,"Thank you, Lin! Oogi, yip yip.",10,1,10
,"Tenzin takes to the sky on Oogi. Lin turns her head back to Meelo, who is picking his nose.",10,1,10
Meelo,I gotta poo! [Lin holds him farther away from herself.] Really bad!,10,1,10
,"Meelo grunts and Lin quickly metal bends a cable around his waist to avoid touching the soiled child. Lin makes a disgusted face and hurriedly carries him away. Cut to a large house in Republic City, before cutting to a room inside. The Fire Nation representative of the United Republic Council is pacing nervously about the room, while her husband is absorbed in a newspaper.",10,1,10
Councilwoman,Do you know where my keys are? I can't find them anywhere!,10,1,10
Husband,"[Reading the newspapers; uninterested.] No, dear.",10,1,10
Councilwoman,"[Pulling them out of her purse.] Oh, found them!",10,1,10
Husband,"[Uninterested.] Good, dear.",10,1,10
Councilwoman,Don't wait up for me; this council session will probably go late into the night. [Hears a knock at the front door and rushes to answer it.],10,1,10
Husband,"[Uninterested.] The door, dear.",10,1,10
,"The councilwoman opens the door to find two men in uniforms standing on the front step, one of which is actually Amon's Lieutenant in disguise. He quickly gives a sly smile before looking normal.",10,1,10
Lieutenant,We're here to fix a spider-rat problem. [Holds up spray hose and poison can.],10,1,10
Councilwoman,I didn't call an exterminator.,10,1,10
,"The Lieutenant electrocutes her with the spray hose, which is actually disguised Equalist equipment. Both step into the house as a thumb of her body collapsing onto the ground can be heard.",10,1,10
Husband,[Worried.] Dear?,10,1,10
,"Cut to Tenzin landing on the roof of City Hall on Oogi. He dismounts and walks around the dome, where several workers are cleaning the glass. They nod at each other as Tenzin passes. He walks a few steps further, but pauses as he hears the fizz of electricity. He ducks in surprise as an electrified disk spirals over his head, and spins midair as another barely misses him. He lands on his feet as the Equalists in disguise drop to the ground and seize his wrists with bolas. Tenzin dodges their attacks, and airbends himself high into the air with an air sprout. The Equalist who was still standing on the ground is flung backward against the concrete wall by a gust of wind; he slumps down against it. Switch to a looking up short of Tenzin riding his air spout and the two Equalists holding onto their bolas for dear life as they are spun around. Unable to hold on any longer, they release their grip and are flung onto a nearby rooftop. Tenzin lands back on the ground as the door opens and the council page comes out.",10,1,10
Council page,"Aah! [Covering his face as the wind dies down, and lowers his arms.] Ah, I'm so relieved to see you!",10,1,10
Tenzin,The other council members. Are they all right?,10,1,10
Council page,[Looks worried.] I'm afraid not! I just received a call from Chief Saikhan. They've all been captured!,10,1,10
Tenzin,This can't be happening.,10,1,10
Council page,[Holding his hands out toward him.] The leadership of Republic City is in your hands now.,10,1,10

Korra,It's right around here somewhere. [Looks around and spots the car.] There it is.,10,1,10

Asami,"[Sarcastically.] Wow, nice parking job.",10,1,10
Korra,"Hey, you guys got arrested and left me alone with the car! I made it very clear I don't know how to drive.",10,1,10
Bolin,All things considered you did a great job! [Grabs the parking tickets off the windshield.] But how are we going to pay for all these parking tickets?,10,1,10
Mako,"[Mako grabs the parking tickets out of Bolin's hand, crumples them up, and burns them. Bolin gasps in horror.] Relax, the city is under attack. The police have more important things to worry about.",10,1,10
Asami,[Asami opens the trunk and takes out an electrified glove.] This'll come in handy. [Opens the driver's side door and sits down. Mako goes to sit next to her. Asami looks at him disdainfully.] Why don't you sit in back? With Korra.,10,1,10
Mako,I think I will. [Asami starts the car. Bolin sits in front with Asami.],10,1,10

Saikhan,"Tenzin, am I glad to see you. I was afraid you'd been captured too.",10,1,10
Tenzin,I'm the only Council member left. What's the status?,10,1,10
Saikhan,Amon has launched simultaneous attacks across the boroughs. The police are trying to regain control but we're spread too thin.,10,1,10
Tenzin,[Strokes his beard pensively; to the clerks.] I need to send a wire.,10,1,10
Male telegraph operator #2,"To whom, Councilman?",10,1,10

,"Cut to a smoke-filled hallway, where Tenzin walks down with an air dome to protect Saikhan and his workers.

Everyone in Tenzin's party gasp and the camera show an aerial view of six mecha tanks surrounding the entrance.",10,1,10
Tenzin,Not these mecha tanks again!,10,1,10
,"The mecha tanks hold up magnetic arms that attract the metalbender's police uniforms. Two metalbender officers get captured with this magnetism and Tenzin tries to save Saikhan by pulling on him with an air current. However, the magnet is too strong and captures Saikhan. The three mecha tanks deposit their metalbender officers into a truck. One mecha tank fires a pincer cable at Tenzin, but he airbends the cable down and continues attacking the mecha tank. Two mecha tanks fire cables at Tenzin, who once again deflects them with airbending. A mecha tank charges toward Tenzin and fires a pincer cable at Tenzin, knocking him against the wall of police headquarters. Tenzin uses an air wheel to soften his fall. He looks up and the camera changes to his point of view, as he sees the truck drive away.",10,1,10
Tenzin,"Saikhan, no!",10,1,10
,"Tenzin looks up as he sees a burning police airship falling out of sight behind a building. He sees the telegraph operators being captured by Equalists on the City Hall steps. His vision blurs and goes black as the mecha tanks close in. Cut to an aerial view, as six mecha tanks surround Tenzin and close in. Cut to a street, where Asami drives around a corner and floors the gas pedal. Bolin earthbends two ramps in front of the car.",10,1,10
Asami,Jump!,10,1,10
,"Team Avatar bails out of the car before the ramps launch it into the air and knock one mecha tank into another. The four mecha tanks close in on Team Avatar. Mako, Bolin, and Korra engage the tanks with their bending. A mecha tank is attacked with fire, while the one to its left fires a cable, only to be knocked back by a stone slab. The first mecha tank fires a cable at Bolin, who dodges it by launching himself away. Mako attacks a mecha tank, only to be grabbed by a cable and electrocuted. Mako grabs the cable and redirects the electricity at the mecha tank. The electricity courses through the tank as its lights go out and it slumps on itself. Korra melts the nearby snow into two water streams and dodges one of the cable and runs up one of Bolin's ramps and bends the water into the exhaust pipes of another mecha tank. It begins malfunctioning and Bolin uses earthbending to knock it over. Two Equalists have just carried Tenzin to a truck and set him down when Asami electrocutes one from behind. She takes out five more Equalists as they attack her, nimbly dodging their attacks before electrocuting them. Tenzin groans and stands.",10,1,10
Tenzin,[To Asami.] Thank you.,10,1,10
,"Tenzin joins Mako, who is dodging a mecha tank's attacks. Tenzin positions himself beneath the tank and airbends it high into the air, sending it flying into the dome of City Hall. Cut to a view of the battle through a spyglass, before cutting to Hiroshi in Amon's airship.",10,1,10
Hiroshi,[To Amon.] Tenzin has escaped once again. I can't stand to see Asami fighting alongside those benders.,10,1,10

Tenzin,"I'm fine. Thank you, kids. Another moment later and I would have been on my way to Amon.",10,1,10
Mako,"Uh, guys ... look.",10,1,10
,"He points down the street, where an Equalist airship can be seen arriving at Air Temple Island.",10,1,10
Tenzin,Oh no.,10,1,10
,"Cut to the airship as the hatch opens and the Lieutenant and a group of chi blockers can be seen inside. They look down at the island as a metal hook and cable fires from above their heads and attaches to the temple's stone steps. The chi blockers use harnesses to slide down the cable to the island. The White Lotus sentries are watching and charge forward to confront them. Cut to Lin standing in the courtyard, as Tenzin's family watches from the balcony.",10,1,10
Lin,"Everyone, hide inside and remain calm. [Pema screams in pain; Lin turns around to face her.] Pull it together, Pema! Didn't I just say ""remain calm""?",10,1,10
Ikki,"[To Pema, who is leaning over with her hand on her stomach.] Mommy, what's wrong?",10,1,10
Pema,[In pain.] The baby's coming!,10,1,10

They begin bending at them as a cable from a second airship buries itself in the steps immediately below them. More chi blockers swing down, followed by the Lieutenant. Cut to Lin standing guard in the courtyard, as she listens to booted feet running. The Lieutenant and a group of chi blockers race up the steps and charge. Lin uses her cables to take out two chi blockers, before grabbing another Equalist with the cable. An Equalist runs up to her, which she intercepts with an earth column. She bends out another earth column and shoots the projectile to an Equalist's face. She groans and slams the floor, creating three earth columns that send the Equalists flying into the air. Cut to Pema in bed, as an Air Acolyte puts a cloth on her forehead.",10,1,10
Pema,"The children, where are they?",10,1,10
Air Acolyte woman,"Don't worry. They're in the other room, totally safe.",10,1,10

Meelo,[Climbs onto Tenzin's shoulder and pulls on his father's head.] We caught the bad guys.,10,1,10
Tenzin,[To Lin.] You let them fight? Do you realize what could have happened?,10,1,10
Lin,"I would have been toast if it weren't for your kids. [Folds her arms.] You should be proud. You taught them well. [Tenzin looks over his shoulder at Meelo and down at Jinora and Ikki.] Go on, be with your wife.",10,1,10

Tenzin,"[Puts his finger on the baby's chin and it coos.] Hello. [Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora peer into the room.] Come, meet your new brother.",10,1,10
Meelo,[Walks into the room with his sisters.] A brother? Well it's about time!,10,1,10
Ikki,"[To the baby.] Welcome, I'm Ikki, and this is Jinora and Meelo. We have a super great family and we're so happy that you're a part of it.",10,1,10

Korra,"What do you want to do, Tenzin?",10,1,10
Tenzin,"[Sighs.] I need to protect my family, and get them as far away from this conflict as possible. If Amon got his hands on my children ... I hate to even think of it.",10,1,10
Lin,"If you're leaving, then I'm going with you.",10,1,10
Tenzin,But-,10,1,10
Lin,No arguments. You and your family are the last airbenders. There's no way in the world I'm letting Amon take your bending away.,10,1,10

Korra,[Determined.] I'm not giving up.,10,1,10

,Lieutenant slides down the slope and jumps off to attack them. Naga jumps up and uses her right paw to smack the Lieutenant off of the cliff face as they run past.,10,1,10
Korra,"Nice one, Naga!",10,1,10
,"Naga runs to the pier and jumps into the water. Korra waterbends a large water bubble around them as Naga swims to safety. The camera pans up to show Republic City under siege. Cuts to Oogi trying to evade the Equalist airships, but they are coming closer to them.",10,1,10
Lin,[To Tenzin.] They're gaining on us!,10,1,10
Tenzin,"[Cracks his reins.] Faster, Oogi!",10,1,10
,"Oogi speeds up, but an Equalist airship shoots out a large net at them. Lin metalbends her cables to break the net apart and wraps her cable around the rope. She stands and looks at the family with sorrow as they look at the airships in fear. She looks away before turning back at them.",10,1,10
Lin,"Whatever happens to me, don't turn back!",10,1,10
Tenzin,"[Turns his head to Lin.] Lin, what are you doing?!",10,1,10
,"Lin runs and jumps off Oogi, reeling herself up and landing on the airship. She takes her stance and rips off a large section of the airship's metal skin. There is an explosion and it begins to fall into the harbor below. Lin metalbends a panel to catapult herself to the other airship. She begins to rip apart the airship when Equalists come up behind her. They wrap their bolas wrapped around her body and feet, electrocuting her into unconsciousness. The last airship turns back as the family gazes at it in shock.",10,1,10

Hiroshi Sato,"It is a glorious day, my Equalist brothers and sisters! Amon has torn down the tyrannical bending government!

The camera zooms out to show that the island is covered in fog.] and he has the Avatar on the run. [Cut to Hiroshi Sato speaking.] Our great leader has a vision for the future. One day soon, bending will no longer exist and we will live in a world where everyone is finally equal! The United Forces are on their way right now to try and stop that dream. But we will prevail!",11,1,11
,"The crowd cheers loudly in response. Near the back, two chi blockers look at each other, one male, the other female, before they turn and walk away. They push aside a clump of bushes in Republic City Park and enter a small clearing with a large rock in the center. One earthbends the rock aside, revealing a hole, and both jump inside as the rock slides back over. Cut to the chi blockers, who have removed their masks and revealed themselves to be Korra and Mako, walking down a dim hallway.",11,1,11
Korra,"[Angrily.] Can you believe Hiroshi?! ""The Avatar's on the run"". I'm not running from anyone! Let's go back up there and knock some heads; they'll never know what hit 'em. [Turns to go back to do that.]",11,1,11
Mako,Relax. General Iroh's coming with an entire fleet of battleships. Then Amon will be the one who's running.,11,1,11
Korra,"[Frowns.] I hate this ""being patient"" stuff. [Both turn and walk on.]",11,1,11

Amon,"You will now be cleansed of your impurity. [Stands behind the man, who watches with fear, and removes the man's bending; the policeman collapses and falls over from exhaustion. Turns to the Lieutenant.] Next.",11,1,11
,"The Lieutenant nods and walks over to get the next victim, revealing a long line of benders, blindfolded and hands bounded, including the White Lotus sentries, waiting for Amon to strip them of their bending.

Ships are bombarded, causing major damage on board. One plane drops down two torpedoes and Korra dodges them only for them to hit the side of a ship. The explosion forces Korra back but she swims to the ship again. More planes drop down torpedoes to hit their targets.",11,1,11
Male sailor,[Shouting.] Incoming!,11,1,11
,"The explosion forces the sailors up in the air. A plane dives in to attack, but firebenders firebend into the cannons and shoot the planes.

Planes fly around until one gets hit with firebending, forcing the pilot to eject. Iroh and two other firebenders use their bending to take down the planes, successfully hitting one. Korra dives into the water, waterbends a massive waterspout, and bends out a large ice spike to take a plane down. However, the damaged plane hits the waterspout and Korra falls into the water where she bends a torpedo around into the air and hits another plane. She emerges once more and swims to the closest ship. Iroh comes up from the hatch to firebend the remaining planes, taking them down one by one but the last plane drops a bomb in front of him. He uses firebending to shield himself, but the explosion causes him to fall into the water, unconscious. Korra grabs and brings him to the surface.",11,1,11
Korra,"[Swimming.] It's all right, I've got you.",11,1,11
Iroh,[Coughing.] Avatar Korra? You saved my life. Thank you.,11,1,11
,"Korra waterbends them away from the wreckage. Cut to their hideout, where Korra uses her healing abilities on Iroh's wound.",11,1,11
Iroh,"I was prepared to deal with Sato's mecha tanks, but not these new high-speed aircraft.",11,1,11
Korra,"I know. [Moving the water near Iroh's wound.] Every time we think we have an advantage, Amon outsmarts us.",11,1,11
Bolin,"No matter what our plan is, he always has a better one.",11,1,11
Iroh,"Amon is winning so far, but we're not out of the fight yet.",11,1,11
Bolin,"[Now happily.] I like this man's confidence! So, how are we not out of the fight?",11,1,11
Iroh,"[Stands up, clutching his wound.] A second wave of reinforcements is on the way, but I need to warn them. [To Korra.] Do you still have a way to get a message out?",11,1,11
Korra,I know just the man for the job.,11,1,11
,"Cut to Gommu, setting up a telegraph machine while Iroh and Team Avatar stand behind him.",11,1,11
Gommu,And who is the recipient of this top secret message?,11,1,11
Iroh,Commander Bumi. [Gommu cracks his fingers.] Second division of the United Forces.,11,1,11
Korra,Tenzin's brother?,11,1,11
Iroh,"Yes, bit of a wild man, but the bravest commander you'll ever meet.",11,1,11
Gommu,"Ready, sir. [Taps out the telegram as Iroh speaks.]",11,1,11
Iroh,"Fleet ambushed and destroyed by Equalist aircraft. Retreat to Red Sand Island until my signal. Do not approach city until you receive the all clear. [Gommu finishes the telegram. Cut to a map of Republic City on a table.] Now comes the hard part. We need to ground those aircrafts. Otherwise, Bumi's fleet would never be able to retake the city.",11,1,11
Mako,[Points at the map.] They flew in from this direction. The airfield must be somewhere over this mountain range.,11,1,11
Iroh,"Everyone get ready, we leave at dawn.",11,1,11
,They walk out of the room. Asami lingers momentarily.,11,1,11
Asami,[Somewhat bitterly.] It's time to take down my father. [Catches up with them.],11,1,11
Korra,"[Lingers behind the group.] Wait, I'm sorry, but I'm not going with you tomorrow.",11,1,11
Mako,What?,11,1,11
Asami,Why not?,11,1,11
Korra,I'm sick and tired of hiding from Amon. It's time I face him.,11,1,11
Iroh,That's not a good plan. We need to stick together.,11,1,11
Korra,"I'm not waiting for him to hunt me down. My guts tell me it's time to end this, on my terms.",11,1,11
Iroh,"Korra, this is not a mission you should be handling alone.",11,1,11
Mako,She won't be. [Walks up to Korra and Asami has a look of surprise on her face.] I'm going with you.,11,1,11
Korra,[Worried.] You don't have to do that.,11,1,11
Mako,"Yes, I do.",11,1,11
,"Cut to Asami looking on with shock and sadness as she glances to the side. Camera pans to the right to Iroh with a hand on his chin, deep in thought.",11,1,11
Iroh,Hmm ... My grandfather would respect the Avatar's instinct. [Moves his hand down and looks to Korra.] So will I.,11,1,11
,Cut to a view of Republic City in the morning. Cut to Mako wearing Equalist clothing in the hobos' hideout. Bolin walks up to Mako and they hug.,11,1,11
Mako,"Love you, little bro.",11,1,11
,"In the background, Gommu sniffles and cries at the scene.",11,1,11
Bolin,"Love you back, big bro. [Walks up to Korra, who is standing next to Naga.] Korra, Amon is a nasty dude. Be careful.",11,1,11
Korra,"I will. [Hugs Bolin.] Good luck. If you're going into the mountains, you should bring Naga. [Hugs Naga. To Naga.] Take good care of Bolin for me. [Naga licks Bolin.]",11,1,11
Mako,"Asami. [Asami turns around to face him.] I'm sorry things got so messed up between us, but whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.",11,1,11
Asami,"I care about you, too. [Kisses him on the cheek and runs to Bolin and Iroh.]",11,1,11
,"Korra walks next to Mako and they walk away. Asami jumps onto Naga's back, joining Pabu, Bolin, and Iroh.",11,1,11
Gommu,"Good fortune and success to you, valiant heroes.",11,1,11
,"Cut to a large sewage pipe, out of which Korra and Mako walk. They continue walking into the sea and Korra waterbends a large bubble so they can breathe while underwater. Cut to the shores of Air Temple Island. Korra and Mako walk out of the sea and Korra stops waterbending the bubble. They put on their chi blocker masks and climb up the rocky shores. Cut to a closer shot of an Equalist airship, which Amon boards.",11,1,11
Korra,There's Amon.,11,1,11
Mako,"We need to get into the temple. Then, when he returns ...",11,1,11
Korra,We ambush him.,11,1,11
,"They walk toward the temple, but stop when they hear a voice from behind.",11,1,11
Lieutenant,What are you two doing here?,11,1,11
Mako,"Uh, we were just transferred.",11,1,11
Lieutenant,"Well, you're getting transferred again. Amon wants extra security at the arena today.",11,1,11
Mako,[Confused.] The arena? For what?,11,1,11
Lieutenant,The rally. You should've been briefed about this.,11,1,11
Korra,"[Bows.] We'll be there, sir. [As the Lieutenant walks away. Whispering to Mako.] I know another way in. [They scoot to the side slowly and stealthily.]",11,1,11
,Cut to another part of Air Temple Island. Korra lifts a wooden panel on a wall and they climb in.,11,1,11
Korra,Let's hide in the attic.,11,1,11
,They climb up through the attic's trapdoor.,11,1,11
Mako,"Uh, we're not alone up here.",11,1,11
,"The camera shows Tarrlok sitting on the floor, locked behind bars.",11,1,11
Korra,Tarrlok?,11,1,11
,Korra and Mako take off their chi blocker masks.,11,1,11
Tarrlok,I don't suppose you're here to rescue me.,11,1,11
Korra,[Walks up to the cell.] We had no idea you were here. Are there other prisoners on the island?,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"No, I'm the only one.",11,1,11
Korra,And what makes you so special?,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"I'm Amon's brother. [Korra gasps. Cut to the camera panning across the bay of Republic City and a view of Aang Memorial Island with the bay shrouded in fog. Voice-over.] Amon is from the Northern Water Tribe. [Cut to inside Tarrlok's cell looking outward at Mako and Korra.] He's a waterbender and a bloodbender, [Frontal shot of Tarrlok as he lifts his head up.] just like I was.",11,1,11
Korra,[Surprised.] What?,11,1,11
,Korra and an equally shocked Mako glance at each other and back at Tarrlok. Mako takes a step forward to Tarrlok's cell.,11,1,11
Mako,Did you know this all along?,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Cut to Tarrlok.] No, [Bends his head down.] not until after he captured me.",11,1,11
,Camera cuts to a side-view of the entire scene.,11,1,11
Korra,How did your brother end up becoming Amon?,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Cut to a close-up side-shot of Tarrlok's face.] It all began with my father, [Scene fades to a smiling Yakone sitting in a hospital. A surgeon is standing in the background and he walks toward Yakone, who lies down on a pillow. Voice-over.] Yakone. With the help of his former gang, [Switch to Yakone's point of view as a nurse and the surgeon, holding a scalpel, loom over him.] he escaped prison and underwent surgery to change his appearance. [Camera fades to show the surgeon's point of view. A doctor cuts off Yakone's facial bandages to reveal his new face. All the bandages fall off and Yakone now looks younger and has darker hair.] He assumed a new identity, and settled down in the Northern Water Tribe. [Cut to some snowy hills in the Northern Water Tribe.] That's where he met my mother, [Cut to Tarrlok's mother, who is sewing a coat.] a warm, caring woman. [She looks at Yakone and slightly blushes. Yakone, though a bit surprised at first, in turn smiles at her.] Before long, they started a family together. [Cut to Yakone and his wife standing outside a home, a boy runs in front of the camera, laughing, followed by his younger brother.] Amon was the firstborn, under the name Noatak. I was born three years later. [The young Tarrlok plays with his older brother and attempts to tackle him, but falls into the snow. Noatak helps him out of the snow a cheers him up as he tears up. They laugh at one another.] Noatak was a good-natured kid, always looking out for me. Those were the good years. [Fade to the night sky, under which Noatak and Tarrlok practice waterbending with floating globs of water.] Before my brother and I discovered we were waterbenders. At first we were excited by our new abilities, but our training brought out a different side of my father.",11,1,11
Yakone,"Tarrlok, you'd better shape up or you'll be out here in the cold all night until you get it right.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,"I'm trying, but-",11,1,11
Yakone,Try harder! [Tarrlok drops his glob of water.] Your brother was never this sloppy. [Tarrlok rubs his eyes as he tears up.],11,1,11
Noatak,"Dad, he'll get it. He just needs time.",11,1,11
Yakone,"Don't talk back to me, son! Ever!",11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] Even back then, my brother wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally. [Scene fades to Tarrlok and Noatak pulling a sled.] When I was seven, my father took me and Noatak on a hunting trip far away from our home. [Cut to a campfire around which Yakone and his sons sit.] He told us his true identity was Yakone, Republic City's most notorious crime boss, and that he was once a bloodbender of rare skill.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,[Inside the flashback.] What's bloodbending?,11,1,11
Yakone,"The most powerful and feared form of bending in the world. It was declared illegal thanks to that coward, Katara. Our family has the strongest line of bloodbenders in history. You boys have this power inside of you, and I will teach you to master it.",11,1,11
Noatak,"[Looks away with a slight sigh, and asks his father a question.] What happened to your bending, Dad?",11,1,11
Yakone,"The Avatar stole it from me. [Stands up.] That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny. You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order. When the time is right, you will claim Republic City and you will destroy the Avatar. You must avenge me. That is your purpose in life.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] The good days were behind us. [Cut to Yakone and his sons hiding from a herd of yaks.] Every full moon, our father took us on another supposed ""hunting trip,"" where he secretly trained us in bloodbending. [Yakone nods to Noatak, who stands up.] We kept the truth from my mother.",11,1,11
,"Noatak bloodbends the creature, making it stand up, and forces its head back. The yak groans in pain.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,[Inside the flashback.] Stop! You're hurting it!,11,1,11
Yakone,"Toughen up, Tarrlok! You'll need a thicker skin for this. [Noatak lets the yak down and it runs away along with rest of the herd.] Very good, son, very good.",11,1,11
,Cut to Yakone and his sons hiding from a pack of wolves during the day.,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] A few years later, my father taught us to bloodbend anytime, without the need of the full moon. [Yakone signals to Tarrlok, who exhales and gets up.] We practiced constantly, and I hated every minute of it. [Tarrlok jumps over the small ledge and uses bloodbending to make the wolves stand in a row and move from side to side. Closer shot of the wolves whining before Tarrlok lets them go.] I had no stomach for manipulating helpless animals. My brother, however, seemed to revel in this newfound power. [Noatak breathes and forces the wolves to come back.] He was a prodigy, mastering my father's psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen.",11,1,11
,"Noatak concentrates and the wolves turn around in unison. Noatak lifts his head, making the wolves rise in the air. Cut to a terrified Tarrlok, who gasps. Cut to Yakone, who briefly seems surprised at first, before smiling excitedly. Noatak lowers the wolves, making each one bow to him. The camera zooms back to Yakone and his sons.",11,1,11
Yakone,[To Tarrlok.] That's the way it's done. That's what you need to strive for.,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] Even though Noatak was my father's favorite, it wasn't any easier for him. He carried the burden of all Yakone's expectations and demands. [Cut to Noatak sitting next to a ledge, as Tarrlok watches.] Something changed in Noatak over the years; [Close-up of Noatak. Cut to Yakone and his sons standing in the snow.] the loving brother I once knew became cold and detached. [Lightning and thunder strike in the distance.] Our father pushed us to extremes, and one day, he made us bloodbend each other.",11,1,11
Yakone,"Noatak, go! [Noatak inhales, and Tarrlok struggles against the bloodbending. Tarrlok falls to his knees, and Noatak narrows his eyes, making him lean back.] Excellent. [Noatak bows to his father and frees Tarrlok.] Tarrlok, your turn.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,No. [Stands up.] I won't do it.,11,1,11
Yakone,"[Sternly.] Bloodbend your brother, Tarrlok!",11,1,11
Tarrlok,That felt awful. I don't want to do that to anyone. I never want to bloodbend again.,11,1,11
Yakone,"You're a disgrace, a weakling. I'll teach you a lesson, you insubordinate- [Gasps and struggles against Noatak's bloodbending.]",11,1,11
Noatak,[Moves to stand in front of his brother.] Stay away from him.,11,1,11
Yakone,How dare you bloodbend me!,11,1,11
Noatak,"What're you gonna do about it? You're the weak one. [Bloodbends Yakone onto his knees.] You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your bending away. What could be more powerful than that?",11,1,11
Yakone,I made you what you are. You're mine.,11,1,11
Noatak,"We're your sons, [Swipes his hand to the side.] not your tools of revenge. [To Tarrlok.] Let's go. We can run away from him. [Narrows his eyes.] Forever.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,Run away? But what about Mom? We can't just leave her.,11,1,11
Noatak,He was right about you. You are a weakling. [Throws Yakone a distance away with bloodbending and runs off into the blizzard.],11,1,11
Tarrlok,Noatak! Don't leave! Please! Noatak!,11,1,11
,Cut to Yakone's wife taking animal skins off a clothesline as Yakone and Tarrlok walk toward her.,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"[Voice-over.] My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak. We thought he perished in that storm. My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother. [The scene fades from Tarrlok's mother to Tarrlok's reflection on a plate. The camera pans up to show a depressed Tarrlok.] My father stopped training me. With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered. [Yakone stands up and leaves the table.] And he passed away, a few years later.",11,1,11
,The scene fades from young Tarrlok to older Tarrlok telling the story to Mako and Korra.,11,1,11
Korra,That's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"Avatar Korra. I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world.",11,1,11
Mako,How did you figure out Amon is your brother?,11,1,11
Tarrlok,"When he took my bending, the sensation was somehow familiar. I later recognized it as my brother's bloodbending grip.",11,1,11
Korra,"So, he somehow uses bloodbending to take people's bending.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,"I don't know how he does it, but then again, I've never encountered a bender as strong as Noatak.",11,1,11
Korra,How in the world do we beat him?,11,1,11
Mako,"We can't. Any attack we throw at him, he'll redirect with his mind. That's how he's been able to challenge any bender.",11,1,11
Korra,"[Pacing.] So much for our ambush. If we stay here, we're toast. But there's another way to beat him.",11,1,11
Mako,How?,11,1,11
Korra,"This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us. But finally we have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters ...",11,1,11
Mako,At the rally.,11,1,11
Korra,... We could take away his true power!,11,1,11
Mako,And undermine this whole revolution!,11,1,11
Korra,"[To Tarrlok.] Thank you, for your help. [Tarrlok nods his head and shifts his eyes. Mako starts to leave, but Korra stops him.] We can't just leave him here.",11,1,11
Tarrlok,[Standing up.] Go. Amon can't know anyone spoke with me. [Grabs the cell bars.] Defeat him. Put an end to this sad story. [Korra nods at him.],11,1,11
,Korra and Mako run toward the trapdoor and climb down. Cut to credits.,11,1,11
,"The episode opens to Bolin, Asami, and Iroh riding on Naga in a snowy region. They watch as the biplanes fly above.",12,1,12
Iroh,"I think we've found our secret airfield. [Looks at Bolin.] Bolin, once we get down there, I need you to tear up those runways. We can't let those aircraft take off.",12,1,12
Bolin,"[Salutes.] Aye aye, captain! [Suddenly stands up straight and hurriedly does another salute.] Ooh, general, general. [Starts walking away with Iroh and Asami, but soon hears Naga whine.] All right, you guys wait here until we get back, okay? [Sees Naga raising her foot, he stops her by holding up his hand at a 90 degree angle.] Uh-uh, stay.",12,1,12
,"Naga whines as Pabu chitters. Iroh, Bolin, and Asami approach the Equalist base which seems to lack a perimeter fence; there are posts but no wires.",12,1,12
Asami,[Suspiciously.] Why would there be fence posts but no fence?,12,1,12
,"Iroh, Bolin, and Asami go into the middle of the fence posts, but subsequently cry out in pain as they are electrocuted, and they collapse onto the ground unconscious. Cut to the entrance of the Pro-bending Arena guarded by an Equalist airship and mecha tanks. Cut to an Equalist poster and cut inside at the rally. Korra and Mako wear Equalist disguises and stand guard on a balcony with their hands behind their backs. They nod at each other, ready to expose Amon as a fraud. Amon rises from beneath the platform.",12,1,12
Amon,"Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion! [Crowd cheers.] When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.",12,1,12
Korra,"That's a lie, Amon! [Amon's eyes widen as the camera zooms in on the balcony Korra and Mako are standing on. They both proceed remove their chi blocker masks.] Or should I call you Noatak? [The camera zooms in on Amon's left eye as he narrows it.]",12,1,12
Lieutenant,[To Amon.] You want her taken out?,12,1,12
Amon,"[Raises his left hand.] No. [He walks forward on the stage; to the entire crowd.] Everyone calm down, we have nothing to fear from the Avatar. Let's hear what she has to say.",12,1,12
Korra,Amon has been lying to you. The spirits didn't give him the power to take people's bending away. He uses bloodbending to do it. [Points to Amon.] Amon is a waterbender! [Crowd gasps in surprise.],12,1,12
Lieutenant,[To Amon.] What is this nonsense?,12,1,12
Amon,"[To Korra.] You're desperate, Avatar. Making up stories about me is a pathetic last resort.",12,1,12
Korra,"Your family wasn't killed by a firebender. [Looks at the crowd.] His father was Yakone, [Crowd gasps.] and his brother ... is Councilman Tarrlok.",12,1,12
,The Lieutenant sports a doubting look at first before inquiringly looking at Amon.,12,1,12
Amon,"Hmph, an amusing tale, but I will show you the truth. [Removes his hood, unties his mask and takes it off. The crowd gasps in surprise as a close-up of his ""scarred"" face is shown. Pointing at his ""scar"".] This is what a firebender did to me.",12,1,12
Korra,[Taken aback in surprise.] What? [Looks at Mako.],12,1,12
Equalist supporter,[Murmurs break out in the crowd as Amon puts his mask back on; someone shouts.] The Avatar is lying!,12,1,12
Korra,I'm telling you! [Pointing at Amon.] He's a waterbender. [She turns to Mako; defeated.] They don't believe me. It didn't work!,12,1,12
Mako,[Backing toward Korra.] We said what we had to. Let's get out of here.,12,1,12
,The pair turns around as Equalists spin bolas at them from above the balcony ready to attack. They take fighting stances as they approach the Equalists on their way out.,12,1,12
Amon,"I wouldn't leave yet, Avatar. You'll miss the main event. [Korra and Mako turn around after hearing that. A part of the stage rises with the airbenders Tenzin, Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo tied to each pole and gagged.]",12,1,12
Korra,[In disbelief.] No ... they got away. [She and Mako share a confused look.] We saw them get away!,12,1,12
,Cut back to the aircraft base where Asami lies in her cell. Iroh and Bolin are tied back to back.,12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,"Asami. [Asami stirs and sits up.] Asami, I know I have hurt you ... and I am sorry. But I believe that one day, you will come to your senses and we can be a family again.",12,1,12
Asami,[Angrily.] Are you insane?! How can we be a family after everything you've done?! Mom would hate you for what you've become.,12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,[Enraged.] How dare you? I am avenging her death!,12,1,12
Equalist,"The airplanes are ready for take-off, sir.",12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,"[Turns to the Equalist.] Good, annihilate the fleet.",12,1,12
,Iroh and Bolin gasp and share a look of confusion and shock.,12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,"[Turns to Iroh.] That's right, general. I intercepted your message to Commander Bumi. I know exactly where they're hiding. [Iroh glares at Hiroshi.]",12,1,12
Asami,[Turns to Iroh and Bolin.] How are we gonna get out of here?,12,1,12
Iroh,[Looks at Bolin.] I don't suppose you know how to metalbend?,12,1,12
Bolin,"[Looks at Iroh.] That is a negative, Sir. [Iroh pouts.]",12,1,12
,"Suddenly, there is the sound of running, and the warehouse door explodes inward as Naga comes charging in..",12,1,12
Bolin,[Whispering.] Naga! Over here!,12,1,12
,"Naga breaks the jail door with her front paws, and Pabu climbs onto Bolin's lap.",12,1,12
Bolin,[Looks at Iroh.] Who needs a metalbender? [Ecstatic.] We got Naga! Yeah!,12,1,12
,Cut to the runways of the aircraft.,12,1,12
Iroh,[While running; offscreen.] I'm going after those airplanes.,12,1,12
Bolin,"[Naga suddenly carries Bolin while they are running.] Ahh! No, Naga!",12,1,12
Asami,"[Notices the empty mecha tanks and jumps inside one.] Huh, what do you know ... just like a Future Industries forklift.",12,1,12
,Iroh manages to board one of the planes with his firebending. He throws the pilot off and steers the plane on his own. Cut back to the Pro-bending Arena rally.,12,1,12
Amon,"Tonight, I rid the world of airbending, forever. [Raises his arms.]",12,1,12
Korra,"[In a demanding tone.] Amon, let them go!",12,1,12
Amon,[Somewhat mockingly.] You're welcome to come down here and try to stop me.,12,1,12
Mako,[Somewhat quietly.] He's trying to bait you. [Grabs Korra's arm.],12,1,12
Korra,[Defiantly while trying to wiggle free.] I don't care! We have to save them!,12,1,12
Amon,The Avatar needs to be reminded of the power I possess. [Turns around and walks toward the airbenders.],12,1,12
,"Tenzin looks at his children with worry-filled eyes while futilely trying to break free. Suddenly, Mako generates lightning and directs it to Amon, who dodges the blast and rolls over to the Lieutenant. Mako and Korra use firebending to jump onto the wall and balance themselves vertically to run across it to the stage. Before landing, they both dodge bolas thrown at them and send a barrage of firebending attacks to get the Equalists away from the airbenders, knocking one Equalist off the stage. The crowd disperses and runs away from the stage. Mako continues to fight them as Korra runs to free the airbenders.",12,1,12
Korra,"[Unties the gag around Tenzin's mouth, produces a flame on her finger, and begins to burn the metal chains binding Tenzin.] Where are Pema and the baby?",12,1,12
Tenzin,[Looks at Korra.] In prison.,12,1,12
Korra,Beifong?,12,1,12
Tenzin,I don't know. [Korra breaks the metal chains on his feet.],12,1,12
,"Tenzin immediately runs onto the battlefield, assisting Mako as Korra moves to free the kids. Right after Mako throws a fire punch and fire kick, Tenzin runs in front of him fires two air blasts, which knocks an Equalist and the Lieutenant off the stage. Amon dodges Mako's firebending attack with acrobatic grace, but Tenzin follows with a strong wave of air which he tries to block, but it is too powerful, causing him to be blown off the stage.",12,1,12
Korra,"[Talking to Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo as the latter of the three throws the chains off of himself.] Follow me, kids.",12,1,12
,"Cut to the hallway where Korra, Mako, Tenzin, and the kids have all gathered.",12,1,12
Korra,[Looks at Tenzin.] Get them out of here. We'll create a diversion. [Tenzin nods in understanding.],12,1,12
Tenzin,[Looks at the kids.] Let's go get your mother and the baby.,12,1,12
Meelo,[Raises his arms and shouts.] Prison break!,12,1,12
,"Tenzin and the children run the opposite direction as Amon goes out on the other door. When he starts running, Korra blocks his way with a wall of fire and makes another one to be safe. Mako enters a room with Korra behind him. Amon jumps over the wall of fire and looks to see where they have gone. He hears the door swing and enters that room. Korra hears Amon's footsteps. Amon continues to walk past Korra's hiding place and stops for a moment before continuing. Korra breathes a sigh of relief, but suddenly writhes in pain as Amon bloodbends her out from under the table and into the air.",12,1,12
Mako,[Tries to stop Amon from bloodbending Korra by sending continued attacks of firebending.] Let her go!,12,1,12
,"Amon dodges each attack and bloodbends Mako into submission by lifting him into the air. He slams both of them on the ground and bloodbends Mako in place on the floor, and Korra in a kneeling position. Amon walks around Korra and places his hand on her neck.",12,1,12
Korra,No!,12,1,12
Mako,[Shouts in horror.] Korra!,12,1,12
,"Amon places his other hand on her forehead. Close shot on Korra's eyes. When her eyes close, the shot zooms out as Korra's voiceless scream is heard. Amon lets her go as her body slumps on the ground.",12,1,12
Amon,I told you I would destroy you.,12,1,12
,"Cut back to Iroh fighting the airplanes. Iroh generates lightning and directs it to the middle plane, causing it to crash to the plane beside it. The camera zooms out to the planes dispersing. One pilot shoots an explosive bola at Iroh's plane causing it to get caught up in the main propeller forcing Iroh to bail out before the plane explodes. As Iroh free-falls, he uses his firebending to propel himself to another plane and from there uses a firebending attack to disable one of the propellers on the plane in front of him. Iroh kicks the pilot off the plane and takes control of it. A bomb manages to hit the rear end of the plane. Iroh tries to control the plane while another one above him tries to drop another bomb. He quickly uses his firebending and shoots it, causing the plane above him to explode. Meanwhile, his own plane is on a collision course with the statue of Aang on Aang Memorial Island, which has had Aang's face covered with a mask like Amon wears. Before impact, he quickly jumps out and grabs the Equalist banner, causing it to tear. He hangs in midair and watches the mask fall off the statue.",12,1,12
Iroh,"[Still hanging from the Equalists banner.] Thanks for looking out for me, Aang.",12,1,12
,"Cut back to the aircraft base. Bolin groans as he destroys the runway by earthbending. Three mecha tanks try to attack Bolin with cables, but Naga catches them and pulls them, causing the mecha tanks to topple over and almost hit Bolin, who stands still as if not noticing it.",12,1,12
Bolin,[Backs away from the mecha tank rubble.] Whoa! Thanks Naga.,12,1,12
,Naga runs toward the camera as it cuts to inside the airbase. Asami destroys one of the planes with the mecha tank.,12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,"[In another mecha tank.] Asami, what do you think you're doing? You are aiding the very people who took your mother away!",12,1,12
Asami,[Angered.] You don't feel love for Mom anymore. You're too full of hatred.,12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,"You ungrateful, insolent child! [Close shot of Hiroshi's enraged face.]",12,1,12
,"Hiroshi controls the mecha tank to advance to Asami. Asami tries to stop him by launching the wires, but missed. Asami's eyes widen in fear as Hiroshi's tank hits, throwing her mecha tank away and destroying the faceplate.",12,1,12
Hiroshi Sato,[Angrily.] I now see there is no chance to save you!,12,1,12
,"As Hiroshi is going to hit Asami with his mecha tank's right hand, Bolin sends a rock to the mecha tank's hand to stop it.",12,1,12
Bolin,"[While throwing rocks with earthbending.] Mr. Sato, you are a horrible father!",12,1,12
,"Asami gains momentum and attacks her father. She successfully throws him away using her mecha tank. Hiroshi groans in pain as Asami forces the opening of the mecha tank. Hiroshi looks with fear at his daughter while Asami looks at him with hatred. Her gaze eventually changes into pity as Hiroshi tries to attack her, but Asami is able to dodge it, which he used as a diversion in order to attempt an escape.",12,1,12
Asami,[Sadly and regretfully.] You really are a horrible father.,12,1,12
,"As Hiroshi runs, Asami throws an electrified bola that renders Hiroshi unconscious. Asami sheds a tear as Naga whimpers. Camera changes back to the Pro-bending Arena.",12,1,12
Amon,"[Still bloodbending Mako.] Finally, you are powerless.",12,1,12
,"Korra tries to hit Amon, but is too weak from the loss of her bending to do it and misses. Suddenly, Amon's eyes widen as the voice of the Lieutenant comes from behind him.",12,1,12
Lieutenant,"[Standing behind Amon.] Amon! Everything the Avatar said is true, isn't it? I just saw you bloodbend her. [He removes his mask and smashes it with his feet. His face shows an angry look.] You traitor! I dedicated my life to you!",12,1,12
,"The Lieutenant takes out his kali sticks and runs forward to attack Amon. Right before he gets there, however, Amon glares at him and he is lifted into the air with bloodbending.",12,1,12
Amon,"You've served me well, Lieutenant.",12,1,12
,"Amon casts the Lieutenant aside into a pile of wood and walks toward Mako. He bloodbends his hands, but Mako manages to electrocute him with lightning strong enough to throw him away. He sends two firebending blasts at Amon, but the blasts hit the surrounding wood and trap him. Mako picks up Korra and carries her bridal style as the shot cuts to the hallway with Mako running while still carrying Korra.",12,1,12
Korra,[Weakly.] Mako ... my bending.,12,1,12
Mako,[Still running.] Everything will be all right! We just need to get out of here.,12,1,12
Amon,"[Bloodbends Mako, causing him to drop Korra as she slides. He tosses Mako around like a ragdoll into the walls and ceiling.] I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten the better of me like that. [Still bloodbending Mako into submission.] It is almost a shame to take the bending of someone so talented. Almost.",12,1,12
Korra,[Looks up at Mako and Amon and gasps.] No!,12,1,12
,"Korra instinctively throws a punch at Amon, and it suddenly become a blast of air that shoots down the corridor and slams into Amon and Mako, sending them flying. Amon is sent skidding backward and, despite the mask, it is obvious that he is for once completely stunned..",12,1,12
Amon,[Shocked.] Impossible!,12,1,12
Korra,I - I can airbend? [Stands up straight and yells.] I can airbend!,12,1,12
,"Korra attacks Amon with a flurry of air blasts. Despite his attempts to block, he is flung back and slides to a stop on his side in front of a window. He growls and stretches out his hand. Cut to Korra whose progress is immediately halted due to the bloodbending grip Amon is exerting. Cut to a side-shot as Amon stands up and strengthens his grip on Korra, now using both hands. Switch to a frontal shot of Korra, whose face is contorted in pain and the effort it costs to resist his hold.",12,1,12
Korra,[Struggling.] No ... you ... don't!,12,1,12
,"Korra overcomes it and punctuates the last word with an airbending-infused kick that slams into Amon, blasting him out of the window behind him. As Amon falls, his mask comes off, and he plunges into the sea. Concerned citizens dash to see what happened.",12,1,12
Crowd member #1,Did you see what happened?,12,1,12
,The crowd sees Amon's mask float to the surface. Korra and Mako walk up to the shattered window as cries of the protesters grow.,12,1,12
Crowd member #2,You bending tyrant!,12,1,12
Protester,[Raises his fist to the crowd.] Evil Avatar!,12,1,12
,"As he is gradually sinking, the water washes away his ""scar"". Desperate to save himself, Noatak waterbends a spout to get to the surface. As he gasps for air, riding his water spout high above the crowd, he turns to see the people looking at him in shock.",12,1,12
Crowd member #3,He's waterbending.,12,1,12
Feathered hat man,He is a bender.,12,1,12
Protester,Whoa!,12,1,12
Crowd member #4,The scar is fake.,12,1,12
Crowd member #5,The Avatar was telling the truth.,12,1,12
,"Noatak looks angrily at Korra, which she reciprocates, before jumping into the water again. As Noatak escapes, Mako tries to stop him by firebending, but he misses every shot. After Noatak escapes, Korra and Mako hug each other. Cut to Aang's statue and subsequently to Air Temple Island. The scene changes to the attic where Tarrlok is imprisoned, as Noatak climbs up the stairs and walks toward his cell.",12,1,12
Tarrlok,Noatak.,12,1,12
Noatak,"It's over, brother. I'm sorry for what I had to do to you.",12,1,12
Tarrlok,[Sighs deeply and looks down at the floor.] Our father set us on this path; fate caused us to collide. [Looks up at his brother.] I should have left with you when we were boys.,12,1,12
Noatak,"[Opens the prison door.] Leave with me now. We have a second chance. We can start over, together. [Close-up on Tarrlok's face, who is looking in awe.] Please, you're all I have left in the world.",12,1,12

Lin,[To Korra.] I can't believe Amon got you too.,12,1,12
Bolin,"[Brightly.] Hey, at least you unlocked your airbending! [Everyone turns and glares at him sourly. Pabu chitters.]",12,1,12

Noatak,"[Enthusiastically.] The two of us together again, there's nothing we can't do!",12,1,12
Tarrlok,"[Looks angry and confused.] Yes, Noatak.",12,1,12
Noatak,"Noatak. Hmph, [Chuckles and smiles.] I had almost forgotten the sound of my own name.",12,1,12
,"Tarrlok notices the electrified gloves and looks over to his brother. He takes one, without Noatak seeing him.",12,1,12
Tarrlok,"[Unscrews the lid of the fuel tank, placing the electric glove above it.] It will be just like the good old days.",12,1,12
,"A tear rolls down Noatak's cheek and Tarrlok electrocutes the fuel tank. Further shot of the boat exploding, forming a giant mushroom cloud. Camera changes back to Southern Water Tribe at the White Lotus compound. The camera moves to a large building on poles with Oogi resting outside. Cut to inside where Pema is changing Rohan under the watchful eye of Ikki and Jinora, while Meelo is sleeping on Tenzin's lap. The camera pans to the right, revealing Bolin, Mako, and Asami sitting on the same couch, all with dejected expressions on their faces. The scene moves on to Senna, who has her eyes closed while resting sadly against Tonraq's shoulder. Tonraq, who has his arm around his wife, and Lin, who is sitting beside him, both stare sadly toward the ground in front of them. Upon hearing the sound of a door sliding open, the three adults quickly raise their heads and turn to the door. Cut to a close frontal shot of a sad-faced Katara opening the door. Korra is sitting in the room behind her, though is blocked from view when the elderly healer shuts the door behind her. As she ventures further into the waiting area, all people present stand up and look expectantly at her.",12,1,12
Katara,"I've tried everything in my power, [Cut to a frontal shot of Katara's face.] but ... [Diverts her eyes to the ground.] I cannot restore Korra's bending. [Tenzin looks disappointed.]",12,1,12
Lin,"[Persisting.] But you're the best healer in the world, you have to keep trying!",12,1,12
Katara,"I'm sorry, there's nothing else I can do. Korra can still airbend, but her connection to the other elements has been severed.",12,1,12
,"Lin looks disappointed. Korra exits the healing room, sadly looking at the ground. She stops and eyes everyone upon noticing all the people in the room staring back at her.",12,1,12
Tenzin,It's going to be all right Korra.,12,1,12
Korra,"No, it's not. [Looks angry and disappointed and leaves the house.]",12,1,12

Mako,"Korra, wait.",12,1,12
Korra,[Angrily.] Go away.,12,1,12
Mako,"I will, but I just want you to know, I'm here for you.",12,1,12
Korra,"No, I mean, go away, back to Republic City. Get on with your life.",12,1,12
Mako,[Confused.] What are you talking about?,12,1,12
Korra,I'm not the Avatar anymore. You don't need to do me any favors. [Walks away.],12,1,12
Mako,"[Stops her.] I don't care if you're the Avatar or not. Listen, [Korra turns around so she can see him.] when Tarrlok took you I was losing my mind at the thought of never seeing you again, I realized ... [Hesitates.] I love you, Korra. [Mako put his hand on Korra's cheek.]",12,1,12

Korra,"[Turns away.] Not now Tenzin, I just want to be left alone.",12,1,12

Korra,[Stands up in front of him.] How?,12,1,12
Aang,"When we hit our lowest point, we are open to the greatest change.",12,1,12
,"The camera pulls back to show the expanse behind Aang. Kyoshi and Roku materialise behind him, followed by Kuruk, Yangchen, Szeto, and many others, stretching far into the distance and all looking at Korra. In the Avatar State, Aang put his hands on Korra's forehead and shoulder and restores her bending. The eyes and, in the case of the Air Nomads, tattoos of the other Avatars glow as well before they all fade away. Korra opens her eyes, showing her entering the Avatar State. She raises herself into the air with airbending and sends a blast of air, fire, and earth. She bends the sea at the bottom of the cliff to make a large wave. Korra exits the Avatar State and looks back to see Mako smiling at her.",12,1,12
Korra,"[Runs, jumps on Mako and hugs him.] I love you too.",12,1,12
,"Mako and Korra share a kiss and as the camera pans up to the sky. Cuts back to the village where Korra uses the technique that Aang showed her on Lin to restore her bending. Korra's eyes glow as she enters the Avatar State and light emanates from her thumbs as she uses energybending. When Korra has finished, Lin climbs to her feet and simultaneously lifts several large rocks into the air at once. Everyone watches with awed expressions on their faces, Bolin's eyes almost popping out of his head.",12,1,12

Bolin,"[Serious tone.] Now we all know that our last match was garbage. Terrible! [Gestures with his right hand to Pabu.] Even Pabu could've done a better job. [Pabu walks up to Bolin and puts his paws on his master's side while squeaking. Bolin takes on a more confident and proud posture; in a more cheerful tone.] But that's in the past, [Confidently leans forward in a somewhat defensive pose.] because when you back a Fire Ferret in the corner, well mister, [He throws a strong downward punch.] he comes out fighting! [Bolin confidently raises his fist before his body, while Pabu hisses, arching his back. Bolin confidently points toward the arena.] So, let's get out there [Raises his fist above his head.] and bend like there's [Triumphantly punches in the air with his right fist; camera slowly moves back to show that he is talking to the two other Fire Ferret members.] no tomorrow.

,"Cut to a frontal shot of the other two Fire Ferret members, the male waterbender, who somewhat resembles Mako, sitting dejectedly on the bench, while the female firebender, who somewhat resembles Korra, stands awkwardly next to him. She glances down at her teammate, holding her right elbow with her left arm. The only reaction of either of them comes from the waterbender, who rubs his nose with his left hand, while sniffing. Cut to a close-up of Bolin, whose excited expression has changed to a sad one, as he pensively glances to his left. Cut to a side-view of the Fire Ferrets and the Rhino Lions lined up before each other. As the bell to announce the start of the match rings, both teams ready their respective element. Cut to a shot of the open end of the Fire Ferrets' playing field.

Cut to a frontal shot of the truck as it races off, while the mist fills the entire length of the street. Switch to a side-view of the motorcyclist as he enters the fog. Cut back to a close-up of the back of the truck, water still flowing out of it. One of the men forces his hand down, and as the camera cuts to a wider shot, the water can be seen flowing onto the road, freezing as the truck travels along the street. Cut to a frontal view of the motorcyclist as he emerges from the mist. He gasps as his vehicle starts to slip on the ice. As the motor spins out of control, the driver uses his firebending to create a circle around him, melting the ice, and enabling him to regain control of the bike as its wheels find solid ground. He swerves out of the path of the rest of the ice and resumes his pursuit. Cut to an aerial shot as the truck runs down a road blockade and narrowly misses an incoming police truck from a street to its right. The motorcyclist finds his road now blocked, and swerves to his left, where a truck with wooden beams that form a ramp stands in his way. Without hesitation, he steers his motor onto the ramp. Cut to a side-shot as the driver uses his firebending to launch himself and his bike into the air, where he flips over, and aims a powerful fire stream at the truck's engine as he comes down.

The motorcyclist lands, and stops his vehicle. Cut to an aerial shot of the motorcyclist as the truck races him by, hit a water hydrant, flips on its roof, slides along over the road, and flips to its side. As the vehicle comes to a stop, it partially explodes. Cut to a frontal shot of the destroyed vehicle as two of the three passengers are already lying in front of the truck, and the driver lets himself fall from out of the broken windshield. He lands on top of his two comrades, eliciting a grunt from them. The motorcyclist walks toward them.

Cut to the tower on Air Temple Island, as a sky bison flies toward the camera, groaning. The beast turns, the camera following its movements. As it flies out of the screen, the camera locks on four tiny figures racing down a flight of stairs in the distance. The figures go out of screen, to reappear again up close. All on air scooters, Ikki is the first to come into view, with Korra trailing close behind her, followed by Jinora and Meelo. They take a turn, heading toward the buildings. Cut to an open corridor, where Pema is walking, holding Rohan and some groceries. The four youngsters zoom past her, nearly knocking her over. Startled, she throws the vegetables in the air, as she spins in between the racers. When they are gone, she manages to catch the food again, and stares after the foursome in surprise. Cut to the racers as the swiftly turn around the airbending training gates; some of the panels start spinning as they pass by. The foursome jumps off the platform.

Korra,It's the Avatar State and I'm the Avatar. Who appreciates it more than me?,1,2,13
Tenzin,"Clearly you need more training to grasp the depths of your spiritual connections, not to mention that you're still a long way from mastering airbending.",1,2,13

Korra,"[To the airbender children.] Before we go on your dad's study trip, we're gonna have some real fun in my home town at the Glacier Spirits Festival. They've got rides, games, and all kinds of fried food on sticks.",1,2,13
Tenzin's children,Yay!,1,2,13
,"The kids cheer and circle around Tenzin, who makes a defeated and somewhat frustrated face. Tenzin clenches his eyes shut for a moment and frowns, while Bumi puts an arm around his shoulder.",1,2,13
Bumi,"Yep. There's Vacation Tenzin. And you can't stop me from going to the festival, Mom already invited me.",1,2,13
,"Tenzin's eyes widen slightly for a moment before narrowing in frustration. Cut to an aerial shot of a ship bound for the South Pole at night. Mako, Korra, and Naga are sitting on deck.",1,2,13
Mako,"[Enthusiastically.] So I walk up and say: ""Looks like you had some car trouble. Good thing the police are here."" [Korra widens her eyes.]",1,2,13
Korra,[Closes her eyes while chuckling before looking sideways at Mako with an eyebrow raised and a smile; amused.] Did you write that beforehand?,1,2,13
Mako,"[Still enthusiastic.] Yeah! I had a few others. [Pulls out a list from his jacket and begins reading off of them.] Let's see, uh ... ""Looks like you guys should put more 'try' in triad"", huh? Or, ""when you get to jail, [Points to himself.] tell 'em Mako sent ya"".",1,2,13
Korra,"Ooh, I like that one.",1,2,13
Mako,"[Tucking the piece of paper back into his jacket.] Okay, I'll use that next time. Beifong says if I keep it up, I could make detective soon.",1,2,13
Korra,That sounds so fun. All I do is train all day. It's like Tenzin's totally forgotten how I beat Amon.,1,2,13
Mako,Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.,1,2,13
Korra,[Pulls her arm away from Mako.] Of course you'd take his side!,1,2,13
Mako,"I'm not taking his side, I'm just ...",1,2,13
Korra,[Standing up.] I'm gonna take a walk. [She leaves.],1,2,13
Mako,[To himself.] Why is it so much easier to bust triads than it is to get through one conversation with my girlfriend?,1,2,13
,"Cut to their arrival at the South Pole. The airbending children excitedly greet Katara and Kya, who are awaiting them on the dock.",1,2,13
Tenzin's children,Gran Gran!,1,2,13
,The children all gather around Katara and hug her waist.,1,2,13
Katara,Oh ... you've all gotten so big.,1,2,13
Jinora,"We missed you, Aunt Kya.",1,2,13
Kya,"Ohh, I missed you, too. Your father doesn't bring you to visit nearly enough. He's probably scared I'll beat him up [Lightly punches Tenzin's arm playfully.] like when we were kids.",1,2,13
Tenzin,I'm not scared of you ... [Rubbing his arm; slightly timidly.] anymore.,1,2,13
,The shot cuts to a side-shot of Korra hugging Tonraq while Mako stands behind her and Senna stands to the side.,1,2,13
Korra,[To Tonraq.] You remember Mako.,1,2,13
Mako,[Offers his hand to Tonraq.] Sir.,1,2,13
Tonraq,[Crosses arms; sternly.] I hope you're not getting my daughter into anymore trouble up in the city.,1,2,13
Mako,Uh ... No ... uh ... I ... no.,1,2,13
Korra,"Knock it off, Dad.",1,2,13
,Tonraq laughs and shakes Mako's hand. Bolin walks into frame.,1,2,13
Bolin,Wow! Look at all these people that came out to greet us.,1,2,13
Korra,"Uh, no. They came to greet them.",1,2,13
,"Korra points to a large and ornate Water Tribe ship that approaches across the water. Cut to a long shot of a royal Northern Water Tribe ship docking on the other side of the pier. The crowd claps and cheers. Cut back to Korra, Mako, Bolin, Tonraq, and Senna.",1,2,13
Tonraq,[Sarcastic.] The great chief of the Northern Water Tribe comes to grace us with his [Senna looks at him.] presence. Hooray.,1,2,13
Senna,"[Puts an assuring hand on his arm. Korra looks at him as well.] Just relax [Tonraq looks down on her wife.] Tonraq, he'll be gone [Turns his head back to the ship.] soon enough. [Tonraq sighs while growling. Mako and Bolin turn to him.]",1,2,13
,"Cut to a small arctic hen perched atop the flag pole attached to the ship, the flag waving gently in the breeze. As the bird makes a call and flies off toward the camera and out of frame, the scene cuts to a side shot of Unalaq and his children, Desna and Eska, as they depart the ship walking down the plank to the pier, accompanied by guards. Cut to a close profile shot of Unalaq, before panning down and to the left to Eska and Desna.",1,2,13
Bolin,"Whoa! [Cut to a shot of Korra, Mako, and Bolin. Puts on a flirtatious smile.] Who are the lovely ladies? [Korra glances at Bolin with an amused smile.]",1,2,13
Korra,"That's Eska [Mako turns his eyes toward Bolin, amused as well.] and Desna, the [Cut back to the side-shot of the twins.] chief's children. Desna is a guy.",1,2,13
Bolin,"[Cut back to the shot. Korra turns her eyes back to the three. Bolin's eyes widen in surprise; chuckling.] Oh, no, sure, [Mako turns his eyes back.] I knew that. [Looks to the side.] Uhhh ... [Drops his smile and looks at the twins.] and which one is Desna?",1,2,13
,Bolin's face becomes impassive. Cut to a side shot of Unalaq and his group approaching Korra's group. Tenzin and his family stand in the background.,1,2,13
Unalaq,"[Bowing toward Korra.] Good to see you again, Avatar Korra.",1,2,13
Korra,[Bows toward Unalaq.] Good to see you too.,1,2,13
Unalaq,[Coldly.] Tonraq.,1,2,13
Tonraq,[In the same tone.] Brother.,1,2,13
,"Cut to Mako and Bolin who worriedly look at each other, surprised with the tone the two brothers use to address each other. Cut to a low angle shot of Tonraq and Unalaq facing each other, with everyone else surrounding them. Mako and Bolin turn their eyes back to the two. Switch to a wide establishing shot of the bay at the Southern Water Tribe and pan right to the city. Cut to a shot of people at the festival with the camera slightly panning right.",1,2,13
Unalaq,"It's a shame the Southerners have abandoned all connections to the spirits. [Cut to a side shot of Unalaq, Tonraq, Korra, and Tenzin walking through the carnival.] Even during the most hallowed times.",1,2,13
Korra,[Looks around with a smile.] I've always loved the Glacier Spirits Festival. It's fun.,1,2,13
Unalaq,[Cut to a frontal shot of Korra and Unalaq.] This festival [Korra turns her head to him.] used to be a solemn time of fasting [Unalaq turns to the right.] and meditation. Now it's just [Looks straight again.] a chance to watch some rube try to stick an [Stops and turns left.] entire arctic hen in his mouth.,1,2,13
,"The group stops and looks to the left. Cut to Bolin, who has stuffed a whole arctic hen inside his mouth and is attempting to swallow it. Upon hearing them, he widens his eyes, turns to face the group and shrugs.",1,2,13
Bolin,"What? Oh, it's so good.",1,2,13
,"Bolin closes his eyes and clenches his fists in delight. Cut back to the group, where Korra closes her eyes and slightly shakes her head in amusement.",1,2,13
Tonraq,Traditions change. It's not the end of the world.,1,2,13
Unalaq,Tell that to the sailors who are being attacked by angry spirits in southern waters. [Cut to a close-up of Unalaq.] Some traditions have [Frowns.] purpose.,1,2,13
Korra,"Wait, [Unalaq looks to the right. Cut to a surprised Korra.] spirits are attacking ships?",1,2,13
Unalaq,[Nods.] I'm surprised the Avatar doesn't know about that. Apparently you haven't been given all of the information you need. It would be my honor to instruct you in the spiritual ways of the Water Tribe.,1,2,13
Korra,I wouldn't mind learning about fighting spirits. [Glances at Tenzin.] Airbending is getting pretty boring.,1,2,13
Tonraq,Tenzin is Korra's instructor. He can give her all the training she needs.,1,2,13
Unalaq,[Unconvinced.] So you've said. [Turns and leaves.],1,2,13
,"Scene cuts to a wide shot of a large, white ship before panning down to reveal Asami and Bolin standing in front, with Pabu perching on Bolin shoulder.",1,2,13
Asami,"I'm glad you came with me to this meeting. Varrick is one of the richest men in the world, and he controls the entire global shipping business. So, you're my assistant. Just stand there and don't say anything.",1,2,13
Bolin,"No problem, Pabu and I are natural assistants. [They board the boat; impressed.] Man, this is nice! I got to get into this whole business thing.",1,2,13
,"Cut to inside the yacht. Cut to Varrick is sitting on a cushion, his eyes closed and his fingers pressed against his head in concentration with a look of extreme focus on his face while Zhu Li sits beside him, writing on a notepad. He is surrounded by a number of other people who are all looking at him intently. Camera pans back to reveal Asami and Bolin are among those watching, before cutting to a close-up of Varrick's feet. The camera pans up to his face. He stops suddenly, a massive smile on his face.",1,2,13
Varrick,Did ya see that? [Spreads him arms.] Levitation! [Laughs.] I was a foot off the ground! [His audience begins clapping and murmuring among themselves.] Is that incredible or what? [Cut to the crowd. The camera pans around the room as the guests all clap.],1,2,13
Male guest #1,How does he do that?,1,2,13
Male guest #2,That's unbelievable.,1,2,13
Male guest #3,That's amazing.,1,2,13
,"Cut to a shot of Varrick who stands, his cloak falling from his shoulders as he does so, and bows. Cut to a side shot of Bolin and Asami. Asami claps with a polite smile as Bolin scratches the back of his head.",1,2,13
Bolin,[Slightly confused.] You looked like [Opens and spreads his arms.] you were just sitting on a pillow.,1,2,13
,"A shocked Asami gasps and puts her head in her hands in embarrassment. Cut to a shot of the stunned audience gasping and looking at Bolin. Cut to another shot of the guests turning and glaring at him. Cut to a close-up of a shocked Varrick who looks up at Bolin as well. The inventor stands up and walks over, stopping in front of Bolin, while putting his hands on his hips and intimidatingly gazing at him.",1,2,13
Varrick,Are you saying I wasn't levitating?,1,2,13
Bolin,[Nervously.] Uh ... no?,1,2,13
Varrick,"[Turning back to his audience.] Well, why didn't anyone tell me? Now I look like an idiot! [Points at a man in a red hat, who is also on a pillow.] Swami, you're fired! [The man looks up to Varrick and glares at Bolin before bowing his head and retreating up the steps behind Varrick.] I like you, kid, you're a real straight shooter, just like me. Miss Sato, he's with you? [Asami nods.] Brought your tiger shark with ya to do business, huh? Now that's moxie! [Laughs.] Get over here and pop a squat. Zhu Li, get some tea for my guests!",1,2,13
Asami,"Thank you for meeting with me. As you know, Future Industries is looking for a partner to handle our shipping.",1,2,13
Varrick,"Sure! But first you gotta check out my new venture! Moving pictures! Zhu Li, do the thing! [The servant, who is in the process of serving tea to Bolin, hands the tray to the earthbender and starts a projector.] You're gonna love this! [A moving image of an ostrich horse appears on a screen behind Asami and Varrick.] Mind-blowing, right?",1,2,13
Bolin,[Impressed.] Yeah.,1,2,13
Varrick,"Now forget that! That's the past! Shut it off, Zhu Li! [Zhu Li turns off the projector.] Imagine watching this! [Gestures toward to his left.] Ginger, come over here and do your poses.",1,2,13
,"Bolin gasps in amazement. Cut to a close-up of a red haired woman, Ginger, in a white fur coat, who walks toward them. The camera zooms out as she drops her shawl and strikes a number of poses, as lights and a stylized background flash behind her. Cut back to Bolin, who is looking wide eyed and drooling, until Varrick gets in the way of his view. Bolin tries to look around him at Ginger.",1,2,13
Varrick,"Spectacular! And, we tell a story; there's romance, [Cut to Bolin's point of view.] action, some funny animal stuff for the kids. You know, whatever! Thanks, Ginger, go rest your gams. [Leaps forward and sits between Bolin and Asami; to Bolin.] How about that tiger shark? We're gonna do big business with these movers as I call them.",1,2,13
Asami,Okay ... but I'm just concentrating on getting Future Industries back on track. If we could hammer out a deal ...,1,2,13
Varrick,[Holds up his hand to her face.] Stop! Look me in the eye.,1,2,13
,"Varrick presses his head to Asami, who is initially unsure of what to do, but quickly adopts a determined look on her face. After several seconds of staring, Varrick suddenly breaks away and points his finger at the ceiling, as Asami falls back from her cushion.",1,2,13
Varrick,"We got a deal! [Asami is helped to her feet; Varrick shakes Asami's hands.] We'll hammer out the details at the royal feast tonight. [Turning to his audience.] Now, who wants a rocket boat ride?",1,2,13
,Varrick's guests exclaim their approval before leaving the room.,1,2,13
Bolin,Is that how business usually goes?,1,2,13
Asami,[Happily hugging Bolin and ruffles his hair.] You are a natural assistant!,1,2,13
,"Cut to an enormous hall made out of ice in which a large feast is going on. Korra, her parents, Unalaq, and his children are sat at the head table.",1,2,13
Korra,"This is a wonderful feast in your honor, Uncle.",1,2,13
Unalaq,"This is nothing. When this festival was founded, the tribal elders would commune with the spirits. People would watch the brilliant displays of light as spirits danced in the sky.",1,2,13
Korra,"Wow, I've never seen that.",1,2,13
Unalaq,"And that is a shame, since the Avatar is the bridge between the material world and the spirits. That is why I want so badly to teach you. To help you fulfill your destiny.",1,2,13
Tonraq,I thought I had made it clear that Tenzin is teaching her.,1,2,13
Unalaq,Every Avatar before you traveled the world to learn. It was Tenzin and your father who kept you secluded at the South Pole.,1,2,13
Korra,I thought Aang ordered the White Lotus to keep me down here?,1,2,13
Tonraq,We all did what we thought was best for you.,1,2,13
Korra,"[Crossing her arms.] Who I train with should be my decision, Dad, not yours or Tenzin's.",1,2,13
,"Cut to across the room where Tenzin, Bumi, Kya, and Katara are sat at a table, having overhead the conversation at the head table.",1,2,13
Bumi,Looks like someone's trying to take your place as the Avatar's stick-in-the-mud mentor.,1,2,13
Kya,"Bumi, don't pick on Tenzin. You know he's always been sensitive.",1,2,13
Tenzin,[Defensively.] I'm not sensitive!,1,2,13
,"Bumi and Kya laugh as Kya pokes him, while Katara watches on holding Rohan, a serious look on her face. At the head table, Unalaq stand up in order to give a speech.",1,2,13
Unalaq,"As your chief, it is my honor to speak at this festival, which was founded to bring our tribes together and restore the ancient balance between our world and that of the spirits. But I am saddened to see what it has become: a cheap carnival that celebrates greedy and trivial humans. [Cut to Varrick who is using his plate as a mirror to pick at something in his teeth.] I feel the time is fast approaching when the North can no longer stand idly by while our Southern brothers slip into total spiritual decay. Angry spirits are already attacking ships in your waters. I only hope we are not too late to change course.",1,2,13
,"He sits down, and Varrick stands up to give a speech of his own.",1,2,13
Varrick,"Chief Unalaq everybody, always great to have him in town. Now, let's have some fun with Wacky Wushu's Dancing Otter penguins!",1,2,13
,"A man dressed in purple dances onto the stage, and bends a stream of water onto the platform. Three otter penguins slide along the water, before sliding back, stopping in front of Wushu. All four of them take a bow. Cut to a wide, overhead establishing shot of the festival later at night. Cut to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Mako feeds Korra some cotton candy, which she greatly enjoys before feeding some to Mako, much to Bolin's annoyance, who is eating some balled food off a stick. Bolin turns his head away and his eyes widen. Cut to his perspective, showing Eska and Desna, who are standing beside each other alone, surveying the people walking past. Cut to a frontal shot of Eska and Desna before switching back to Bolin, Mako, and Korra. Clears throat, smirks, and nudges Mako with his elbow.",1,2,13
Bolin,"Wish me luck. [Hands Mako his food.] I'm making my move! [Takes a stance as if he is going to dash away, before going out of the scene with his arms spread out.] Whee!",1,2,13
Mako,Good luck.,1,2,13
Korra,Those two have always creeped me out. They smell like a grandma's attic.,1,2,13
Bolin,"[To Eska.] Hey, I'm Bolin. I'm a friend of Korra's! You're, uh, Eska right? Wow, I'm just, I am loving these robes. [Eska and Desna turn to look at him. Eska hisses at Bolin, who is somewhat taken aback. Bolin clears his throat.] So, you are from the north right? Cool, that's, like you know, that's my favorite direction.",1,2,13
Desna,[To Eska.] I think [Eska's eyes turn to Desna.] he is trying to [She leans over to her brother.] establish some kind of bond with you based on your geographic point of origin. [Eska turns to Desna.],1,2,13
Eska,[To Desna.] Perhaps it would be interesting to spend time with a person whose ways are so rough and uncultured. [Side-shot as she glances in Bolin's direction; to Bolin.] You amuse me. [Smiles.] I will make you mine.,1,2,13
Bolin,"[Cut to a nervously smiling Bolin.] You mean like a boyfriend, or like a slave ...?",1,2,13
Eska,Yes. [Grabs Bolin's collar.] Win me prizes.,1,2,13
,"Bolin laughs nervously as Eska grabs him by his collar and guides him away, while Desna walks beside her. Cut to a carnival game where jets of water are hitting chibi Aang targets. As the water goes into his mouth, a bell ring, his eyes and arrow light up, and the Momo figure above his head starts to rise. Cut to a shot of Mako and Korra from behind, both holding a water squirt gun as they play the game. Mako, looking at his target, is hitting his mark, while Korra, who is looking sideways to Mako, misses.",1,2,13
Korra,Unalaq offered to train me. He says he can teach me about the spirits and my connection to them.,1,2,13
Mako,Sounds good. What does Tenzin think?,1,2,13
Korra,Tenzin thinks I'm his prisoner or one of his kids. I'll never finish training with him in charge.,1,2,13
,"Korra becomes irritated at the entire situation and angrily waterbends a big water stream out of her squirt gun, hitting the chibi Aang's figure's head full on and causing the the Momo cut out quickly reach the top of the meter, winning the carnival game. Cut to the carnival barker shouting through a megaphone.",1,2,13
Game guy,We have a winner!,1,2,13
Korra,"[Cut to a close-up of a plush Appa toy as Korra holds it up.] I mean, you heard what Unalaq said. [Cut to a frontal shot of the duo as Korra lowers the plushie.] The South is spiritually unbalanced and it's the Avatar's job to fix it, but my dad won't even let me think about Unalaq teaching me. Well?",1,2,13
Mako,Well what?,1,2,13
Korra,What do you think I should do?,1,2,13
Mako,I guess you should do what you think is right. I support whatever decision you make.,1,2,13
Korra,[Sarcastically.] Oh thanks. That's a big help.,1,2,13
Mako,I thought you wanted me to be supportive? Now you want me to tell you what I think? Make up your mind!,1,2,13
,She throws the stuffed Appa she won from the game at Mako and storms off.,1,2,13
Korra,Just forget it.,1,2,13
,"Cut to later that night when everyone is asleep. Korra is sleeping against Naga, who awakens and runs outside.",1,2,13
Korra,"Uh, Naga what are you doing? [Naga starts howling, prompting Korra to run outside to quieten her down.] Naga, hush! [Running toward Naga.] Quiet, Naga, you'll wake everyone up! [Naga licks Korra's face and continues to howl, as Bolin and Mako appear.]",1,2,13
Bolin,"[Yawns.] Uh, What's going on?",1,2,13
,"In the distance, Korra sees a dark entity speeding toward them.",1,2,13
Korra,"What, is, that?",1,2,13
,"The spirit quickly makes its way toward the Avatar and attacks her, prompting Mako and Bolin to run toward them. The spirit pins Korra against a wall, and begins to lean in closely toward her, but it is distracted by Mako's and Bolin's attacks.",1,2,13
Bolin,[Earthbends at the spirit.] Got it! [The spirit jumps out of the way.] Don't got it!,1,2,13
,"The spirit slams into the two brothers, knocking them down the hill. Tonraq and Tenzin rush to their aid, helping them up. Korra begins to attack at the entity with firebending, but the spirit is too fast and her attacks fail to hit. The spirit tries for a direct attack, but Korra manages to jump out of the way in time.",1,2,13
Tonraq,[Riding in on a mass of ice.] Korra!,1,2,13
,"Tonraq using his bending to encase the spirit in ice. The spirit appears to have been contained, but several tendrils break through the top of the ice, grabbing both Tonraq and Korra, and throwing them into one of the huts and the ground respectively. The tendrils recede, and the ice explodes as the spirit breaks out completely.",1,2,13
Tenzin,"Spirit, why are you angry with us? What have we done to offend you?",1,2,13
,"Tenzin's attempts to converse with the spirit have no success, and he is batted away by the entity. After Korra recovers, she enters the Avatar State, catching the attention of the spirit. The spirit makes its way toward Korra once more, who lifts herself into the air to dodge its attack, causing the entity to land in the festival market behind her. She shoots a number of fire blasts at the spirit from atop her air spout, but her attacks seem to have no effect, and the spirit grabs her with one of its tendrils, slamming her into a nearby stack of boxes. The spirit stands over Korra, intending to issue another blow, when a stream of water controlled by Unalaq starts to encircle it, and the spirit ceases its attack. As Unalaq continues to bend the water so that it encircles the entity entirely, the water starts to glow, and the spirit changes color. As the water falls to the ground, the spirit begins to walk away, before disappearing.",1,2,13
Unalaq,Go in peace.,1,2,13
,Tenzin and Tonraq run over.,1,2,13
Tonraq,Korra!,1,2,13
Tenzin,Are you all right?,1,2,13
Korra,[To her uncle.] How are you able to control that spirit when no one else could?,1,2,13
Unalaq,"As your father could tell you, I have spent my life studying the spirits and learning their ways. All of this knowledge is lost in the South, but I could teach you everything I know.",1,2,13
Tenzin,"Chief Unalaq, clearly you are very knowledgeable, but Korra still has much to learn about airbending. And I hope that going to the air temples will help her connect with the past Avatars.",1,2,13
Korra,Ugh,1,2,13
Unalaq,[Bluntly.] The air temples will teach her nothing. Only I can give her the training she needs to be a complete Avatar.,1,2,13
Tonraq,I've told you that will not happen!,1,2,13
Korra,Hey! I'm right here! Anyone want to ask me what I think?,1,2,13
Tenzin,"Korra, please listen.",1,2,13
Korra,"I'm tired of listening to you. Both of you. You keep me locked up, telling me you know what's best. But both of you were powerless against the spirit attack. [Pauses.] I think it's time I had a new teacher.",1,2,13
Tonraq,Now Korra—,1,2,13
Korra,Unalaq has proven he's the only one who knows what I need to learn. I have to go with him.,1,2,13
Tenzin,"Please, I know you're angry, but we've come so far together.",1,2,13
Korra,"I'm sorry, Tenzin. This is as far as we go.",1,2,13
Tenzin,"[Tenzin appears hurt, but he remains respectful.] It has been a pleasure serving you, Avatar Korra. [Tenzin walks away.]",1,2,13
,"Cut to the morning, Tenzin is loading Oogi, his wife and children already seated on the flying bison.",1,2,13
Katara,I think you forgot a couple of things. [Katara stands back with Kya and Bumi.],1,2,13
Tenzin,"Mother, I think I need some time alone with my family right now. [He grabs a sack and turns away from his mother.]",1,2,13
Katara,"This is your family, Tenzin. [Cut to a close-up.] When you get to be my age, you'll be thankful for the time you had with your siblings. Besides, I think it's important that you all visit your father's home together.",1,2,13
Bumi,"[Bumi punches Tenzin's arm, before wrapping his arm around Tenzin's shoulders.] Come on! It'll be fun.",1,2,13
Kya,"I'm dying to see that laid back, Vacation Tenzin I've heard so much about.",1,2,13
Tenzin,"All right, hop on! I love you, Mom. [He hugs Katara.] We'll see you soon!",1,2,13
,"Bumi has trouble getting on Oogi, so Tenzin creates an air current under his brother to bring him up to the top of the bison. Cut to Mako and Korra, who are watching Tenzin's family leave on Oogi from farther back.",1,2,13
Korra,Do you think I did the right thing?,1,2,13
Mako,"[Sighs.] I don't know. I'm sorry, but I'm not very good at this Avatar counseling thing. But I know your heart is in the right place. You'll just have to trust it. [The two hold hands while Unalaq approaches the two from behind.].",1,2,13
Unalaq,"I know this was a hard decision, Korra, but it was the right one. Now it is time to put it behind you and begin your new training. I have great plans for you.",1,2,13
,Fades to credits.,1,2,13
,"The camera pans down to reveal a shot of the Glacier Spirits festival. A dark spirit appears on a nearby cliff, and looks out over the festival. Cut to the camel yak stables, as Korra rides in on Naga, with Unalaq waiting for her. Korra dismounts Naga and approaches her uncle.",2,2,14
Unalaq,You're early.,2,2,14
Korra,What can I say? I'm pumped up to learn that Unalaq spirit fighting.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"[Places his arm on her shoulder.] I'm not here to teach you to fight spirits, I'm here to help you begin your spiritual training. We're going to one of the most remote places in the world, the long neglected spiritual center of your tribe, the South Pole.",2,2,14
Korra,You're going to train me at the South Pole?,2,2,14
Unalaq,"We will do more than just train. By neglecting the spirits, the people of the South have brought darkness upon themselves, and now it threatens to destroy our tribe. We must set things right. The Southern Water Tribe depends on you.",2,2,14
Korra,[Enthusiastically.] A dangerous trip to the South Pole? Count me in!,2,2,14
,"The scene changes to a shot of the Southern Air Temple, which comes into focus through the clouds. Oogi flies into shot heading for the temple, with Tenzin and his family riding on him.",2,2,14
Tenzin,"There it is, the Southern Air Temple. Isn't it magnificent?",2,2,14
,"The scene changes again to two Air Acolytes, one of whom is sweeping, while the other feeds three ring-tailed lemurs. They turn in surprise as Oogi flies in, and as he lands, three Acolytes walk toward the bison, two of them carrying a large case.",2,2,14
Shung,"Master Tenzin, welcome!",2,2,14
Tenzin,"Good to see you again, Abbot Shung. [He and Pema bow toward the abbot.]",2,2,14
Shung,"Is there anything you need? Water? Dandelion greens? Ahh, perhaps you'd like to recenter yourself by meditating in the gardens?",2,2,14
Tenzin,"No thank you, I'm fine.",2,2,14
Shung,"And you must be the honorable Pema! Please, accept these gifts. [Shung reaches into the case, and pulls out an odd contraption, which he hands to Tenzin.] This is an ancient airbender head shaver we've refurbished just for you.",2,2,14
Tenzin,Oh. [Unsure of how to respond.] Okay?,2,2,14
Shung,"And Pema! [He hands Pema a massive bouquet of flowers.] These flowers once filled the mountainside! Now, they can brighten up your room.",2,2,14
Pema,[In a similar manner as Tenzin's response.] That's ... sweet? Y-you didn't have to.,2,2,14
Shung,Nonsense! Whatever you need is yours. Anything for the mother of the next generation of airbenders.,2,2,14
Ikki,[As a female Acolyte hands a book to Jinora as a gift.] No! [Ikki snatches away the book.] That gift is mine!,2,2,14
Jinora,You don't even like to read!,2,2,14
Ikki,[Sticks her tongue out.] Eeeh!,2,2,14
Pema,"[Slightly embarrassed. Wearing a smile.] Yep, those are the world's next generation of [Smile falters.] airbenders.",2,2,14
,"Meelo appears from behind the three Acolytes and jumps on the abbot's back, a lemur held in his hands.",2,2,14
Meelo,"[Excitedly.] Mommy, Daddy, look! I finally got a lemur! I'm gonna name him ... Poki!",2,2,14
,"The lemur flies away, and Meelo jumps down from the abbot and forms an air scooter to chase after the creature.",2,2,14
Meelo,Poki! Come back!,2,2,14
,"Kya and Bumi are still by Oogi, unloading supplies from his saddle. Kya tosses some bags down, which hit Bumi, and he grunts. Kya drops down from on top of the sky bison, and Bumi sighs.",2,2,14
Bumi,"[Somewhat frustratedly at a nearby Air Acolyte.] S'cuse me, a little help here?",2,2,14
Acolyte,"[Just noticing the two siblings, she turns around and stops sweeping.] Sorry, I thought you were the servants. [Bumi and Kya make angry faces.]",2,2,14
Bumi,[More frustrated.] We're Tenzin's brother and sister!,2,2,14
Acolyte,[Shocked.] Avatar Aang had other children? [Excitedly.] The world is filled with more airbenders?,2,2,14
Kya,"[Calm, but upset.] We're not airbenders.",2,2,14
Acolyte,Oh ... [Bows.] I'm so sorry.,2,2,14
,"Bumi and Kya looks a little confused, before pouting and glancing at each other. The scene switches to Korra saddling up Naga, as Mako helps her pack supplies.",2,2,14
Korra,I thought you said Bolin was coming?,2,2,14
Mako,"He said he'd be here, but I can't worry about it. I have to make sure you have everything you need for a safe trip.",2,2,14
Korra,"[Sarcastically, but with a smile.] Thanks, Captain Expedition, but I'll be fine.",2,2,14
,"Korra hears a sound and turns her head around to see Tonraq pulling up on a snowmobile. Unalaq, who has been packing, notices Tonraq and scowls, before approaching his brother.",2,2,14
Unalaq,"Tonraq, what do you want?",2,2,14
Tonraq,I heard you're taking Korra to the South Pole. [Crosses arms.] I'm coming.,2,2,14
Unalaq,[Angrily.] Absolutely not. You're a distraction to Korra and a hindrance to what needs to be done.,2,2,14
Tonraq,My daughter is not going without me! She needs someone to watch after her.,2,2,14
Korra,"[Korra rides up to them on Naga, Mako sitting behind her.] Dad, why do you always think you know what's best for me?",2,2,14
Unalaq,"Because he's misguided. The sad truth is, it's men like your father who have put the Spirit World out of balance. He's ignored my warnings in the past and hasn't learned since.",2,2,14
Korra,What happened in the past?,2,2,14
Tonraq,It doesn't matter. What matters is the Everstorm.,2,2,14
Mako,The Everstorm?,2,2,14
Tonraq,"It's a massive blizzard that's battered the South Pole for decades. [To Unalaq; stubbornly.] I'm coming, unless you think you can stop me.",2,2,14
,"The camera cuts to a close-up of Unalaq, followed by Tonraq, as they glare at each other. Tonraq looks to his left, however, when Bolin shouts at them from a distance.",2,2,14
Bolin,"[Voice-over.] Guys! Hey, wait for me!",2,2,14
,"Bolin zooms in on a snowmobile with an attached sidecar, wearing a new snowsuit. Cut to a confused Mako and Korra as they trail Bolin's arrival with their eyes before turning completely to face him as he pulls up next to them.",2,2,14
Bolin,"Check it out, [Rests his elbow on the throttle.] I'm traveling in style! [He accidentally turns the throttle causing the vehicle to jerk forward, but promptly stops the vehicle.] Okay, uh, sorry, still getting used to that throttle.",2,2,14
Mako,"Uh, where'd you get the ride?",2,2,14
Bolin,"Varrick; he's awesome! He also gave me this fancy snowsuit! It's inflatable, with an internal heater, emergency beacon, and food ration pouches! I mean, if I get lost, I can survive in this thing for like, like a month! [Reaches into his snowsuit.] Who wants some freeze dried cucumberquats. [He pulls out several cucumberquat slices and offers them to the crowd.] Nobody? ... Did I interrupt a conversation? [Pabu pops out of Bolin's suit and eats some of the cucumberquats.]",2,2,14
Korra,"[Strongly.] No, the conversation is over. [To Tonraq.] Dad, come if you want, just don't interfere with my training. [She rides away from the group, as Eska gets off of her camel yak and approaches Bolin.].",2,2,14
Eska,Does this sidecar have the capacity for two passengers?,2,2,14
Bolin,"[Flirting.] Sure does. But, uh ... who's gonna drive?",2,2,14
,"Cut to later that night. Bolin is driving the snowmobile while Desna and Eska sit together in the sidecar. Bolin looks upset with the circumstances, and Mako rides toward the trio on a camel yak.",2,2,14
Mako,"[Teasing.] Well, what do you know? Looks like--",2,2,14
Bolin,"[Annoyed.] Go away, Mako.",2,2,14
Korra,"[To Unalaq.] So once we get to the South Pole, then what happens?",2,2,14
Unalaq,You will open an ancient spirit portal.,2,2,14
Korra,"I'm sorry, what now?",2,2,14
Unalaq,"At the South Pole, there is a portal that connects our world to the Spirit World, but it has long been closed.",2,2,14
Korra,And that's why the evil spirits are attacking?,2,2,14
Unalaq,"There are no evil spirits, there is light and dark in them all. But when they're unbalanced, the darkness takes over. [The Everstorm appears in the distance, and thunder from it is heard.] If you can open the portal in time, balance will be restored.",2,2,14
Korra,What do you mean ... in time?,2,2,14
Unalaq,There's a reason the Glacier Spirits Festival ends on the winter solstice. That's when the Spirit World and the physical world are close together. Only then can the Avatar open the portal.,2,2,14
Korra,The winter solstice is tomorrow.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"Exactly, and we can't afford to wait another year.",2,2,14
,"A dark spirit appears in the distance, watching the group. Naga, sensing the creature, turns toward it and starts growling.",2,2,14
Korra,"Easy, Naga.",2,2,14
,"The fog begins to clear, and the dark spirit, now joined by two others, comes into view.",2,2,14
Bolin,[Shrinking.] What are those?,2,2,14
Korra,Dark spirits.,2,2,14
,"The fog picks up again, hiding the spirits from view once more.",2,2,14
Tonraq,Let's keep moving. We have to find a safe place to set up camp.,2,2,14
,"Tonraq drives away, and the scene cuts to a roaring fire, the group huddled around it for warmth.",2,2,14
Korra,"Uncle, why do you think the dark spirits are following us?",2,2,14
Bolin,"Can we not talk about dark spirits, please? [Scoots next to Eska and grabs her arm.]",2,2,14
Mako,My brother doesn't like ghost stories.,2,2,14
Eska,"[Dryly.] Don't worry. I will protect you, my feeble turtle duck.",2,2,14
Bolin,Thank you.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"Sadly, this isn't a ghost story. This is real. [Bolin gasps and closes his hood.] The spirits are angry because he's here. [Looks toward his brother; to Korra.] Haven't you ever wondered how your father ended up in the South Pole? Why he's never taken you to visit his homeland in the North?",2,2,14
Tonraq,"Unalaq, this is not the time.",2,2,14
Unalaq,You're right. You should have told her a long time ago.,2,2,14
Korra,Told me what!?,2,2,14
Tonraq,[Sighs.] I left the North Pole because ... I was banished.,2,2,14
Korra,You were banished from the North? Why?,2,2,14
Tonraq,"Because I almost destroyed the entire tribe. [He continues his narration, as the scene changes to a younger looking Tonraq.] Twenty years ago, I was a general in the Northern Water Tribe, sworn to protect my people.",2,2,14
Young Unalaq,[Rides in to young Tonraq's camp.] Brother! We're being attacked!,2,2,14
,"Tonraq gets upset and charges out, as the scene changes to a damaged Northern Water Tribe, several plumes of smoke visible in the distance. The scene changes to inside the city, as the people attempt to defend themselves against the barbarians. One of the barbarians is hit from behind by a stream of water, revealed to be Tonraq, who has entered the city with two other water Tribe soldiers. Tonraq bends water from a nearby river in preparation for a second attack. The scene changes to outside the city, the barbarians in retreat, followed closely by Tonraq and his men.",2,2,14
Tonraq,[Voice-over.] I drove them out of the city and deep into the frozen tundra.,2,2,14
,"Tonraq yells as he and his men chase the barbarians. Cut back to Unalaq, who watches his older brother leave from the entrance to the city. Cut back to Tonraq and his men, who have a reached a large forest situated in the tundra. Cut to inside the forest.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"[Voice-over.] We tracked them deep into an ancient forest. Many believed this forest was the home to spirits, and the barbarians retreated there because they thought we wouldn't attack them on such hallow grounds. They thought wrong.",2,2,14
,"The barbarians are shown hiding behind trees. Three Northern waterbenders suddenly appear and summon a large wave, which crashes into the forest and washes away many barbarians. Tonraq is shown blasting unseen barbarians with three water attacks. Next, the Northern soldiers are seen marching the captured barbarians away from the now flooded forest, which is seen in the background. Tonraq continues narrating.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"[Voice-over.] We captured the barbarians, but in the process, we destroyed the forest. [Shown awakening in his bedroom.] I didn't realize the consequences of what I had done. [Jumps from his bed and runs to a window overlooking the city.] By destroying the forest, I unknowingly let loose angry spirits.",2,2,14
,"Two tribesmen are running from a large dark spirit. Tonraq attacks the spirit with two water whips, and jumps aside when the spirit attacks with its arm.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"[Voice-over.] They threatened to destroy everything, the entire city.",2,2,14
,"The dark spirit prepares to attack Tonraq once more, but stops as water surrounds it before glowing. Camera pans to Unalaq waterbending. Cut to a further view where four spirits are surrounded with the same glowing water, before changing to a golden color. Cut to the spirits returning to the spirit forest before disappearing. Cut back to Unalaq as he ceases his waterbending.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"[Voice-over.] Unalaq was able to guide the spirits back to the forest. But by then, the damage had been done. [Cut to an aerial view of a damaged Northern Water Tribe, before changing to the throne room, where Tonraq's father is seated with Unalaq next to him, and Tonraq standing beneath a flight of stairs.] For being the cause of so much devastation, my father banished me from the Northern Water Tribe in shame.",2,2,14
,"Cut to Unalaq, who watches on as his brother is banished. Cut to outside the city, as Tonraq sails away from his home. Cut to a closer view of Tonraq, who looks down dejectedly, before turning toward the horizon.",2,2,14
Tonraq,[Voice-over.] That's when I came to the South and started a new life.,2,2,14
,"Cut back to the present time, as Tonraq bows his head in shame. He turns around, and faces the rest of the group.",2,2,14
Bolin,"Whoa, so you [Gestures to Tonraq.] were supposed to be chief, then he [Gestures to Unalaq.] became chief. No wonder you guys don't like each other. [Mako elbows him.] Ow! What? Isn't that what happened?",2,2,14
Korra,[Standing in anger.] I can't believe you kept this from me.,2,2,14
Tonraq,I was protecting you from the shame I brought on the family.,2,2,14
Korra,Why did you keep hiding things from me and then telling me it's for my own protection? I'm tired of you protecting me! [Turns away.],2,2,14
Tonraq,Korra!,2,2,14
,"Cut to a far view of the Southern Air Temple. Cut to Jinora and Tenzin entering the inner sanctuary, which is filled with Avatar statues.",2,2,14
Jinora,"Wow, the statue room.",2,2,14
Tenzin,"That's right, Jinora, the most sacred place in the entire Southern Air Temple. [Cut to a closer view of the statues, as the camera pans up to reveal the various levels.] Here, you will find statues of every Avatar who ever lived. [Cut back to Tenzin, who suddenly looks around the statue room.] Where are your brother and sister?",2,2,14
,"Meelo and Ikki appear behind Tenzin, racing each other on air scooters. The wake from their bending causes Tenzin's robes to blow up and cover his head.",2,2,14
Meelo,You can't catch me! I've the greatest air scooter-er of all time! [Trips over and crashes into a statue.],2,2,14
Tenzin,[Shocked.] Meelo!,2,2,14
,"Tenzin runs to tend to his son. Jinora walks forward to the statue of her grandfather, Avatar Aang, and looks at it in awe. Cut to a close-up of Aang's statue, as the two airbenders lock gazes. Cut to a close-up of Jinora's eye, which dilates suddenly. She looks behind, the camera following her gaze, but there is no one there. Cut to the Southern tundra, a small group of travelers just visible in the white snow. Cut to Korra riding on Naga, an angry look on her face. Tonraq pulls up next to his daughter on his snowmobile.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"Korra, you have every right to be mad at me. But I don't want you to make the same mistake I made. I should never have gone into that forest, and we shouldn't be going to the South Pole now. Spirits and the physical world should remain separate.",2,2,14
Korra,"[Moves forward and turns around, intercepting her father.] Dad, it's my job to be the bridge between the spirits and the physical world, and I finally have a chance to live up to my potential.",2,2,14
Tonraq,[Sternly.] You don't even know if what Unalaq says is true.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"[Stopping his camel between the two of them; defensively.] You want proof? Look to the sky. Where I'm from, the spirits are at peace and they light up the dark.",2,2,14
Korra,The Northern Lights.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"Yes. There used to be lights at the South as well, but during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance and the lights disappeared. When the War ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically, as a nation, but we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.",2,2,14
Mako,[Shouting to the rest of the group.] I think we're here.,2,2,14
,"Korra and Unalaq approach the edge of the cliff Mako has stopped at. Cut to a worried Korra, who gazes at the Everstorm raging in the distance. Cut to the team in the Everstorm, their hoods up to protect their faces against the icy wind. Korra stops and looks back, a roaring in the distance just audible over the wind. Cut to an aerial view of the team, as another, louder roar is heard.",2,2,14
Bolin,[Fearfully.] Is that what I think it is?,2,2,14
Unalaq,We must keep moving. [Looks up as the angry spirits continue to roar.],2,2,14
Bolin,"[Clutching his head.] Oh man, I really don't like this.",2,2,14
Mako,"Bolin, just stay calm, there's no reason to- [A dark spirit emerges from beneath his camel yak and grabs the supplies.] panic!",2,2,14
,"Another dark spirit emerges beneath Naga and lands on her face. Cut to a dark spirit grabbing Unalaq's supplies and another which grabs Korra's supplies. Naga stands on her hind legs, causing Korra to fall from her seat, and chases after the spirit. Korra looks turns and sees a flying spirit emerge. Tonraq forms an ice wall to fend off the spirit but it flies above the wall. Cut to a larger spirit which is running directly at Korra.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"Korra, look out!",2,2,14
,"Tonraq waterbends Korra away and attacks the spirit, but misses and is knocked aside. Another dark spirit enters Bolin's snow mobile.",2,2,14
Bolin,"[Terrified.] Oh, it's in the engine! [Engine explodes in gray smoke as the spirit exits. Bolin loses control of his snowmobile and speeds into the tundra with Desna and Eska.] Aaaahhhhh!",2,2,14
,"Cut to Korra and Mako fighting spirits with firebending. Korra somersaults out of the way and employs Unalaq's purifying move on one of the spirits. The spirit stops in a daze, but it manages to fight it, and pins Korra down. Before the spirit can continue its attack, it is purified by Unalaq and leaves. Mako walks over to Korra and helps her up.",2,2,14
Mako,Is everyone okay?,2,2,14
Bolin,Aaaahhhhh!,2,2,14
,"Cut to the back view of Bolin's snowmobile, which is hurtling away from the group. Cut to Bolin, who is holding onto the handle bars, a terrified look on his face, with Desna and Eska sat next to him, showing no emotion.",2,2,14
Bolin,I can't stop it! [Eska and Desna jump off their seat and onto Bolin's back.],2,2,14
Eska,I'll save you.,2,2,14
,"Cut to the trio leaping off the snowmobile, which crashes into the cliff and explodes. Desna and Eska drop Bolin onto the snow, causing his snowsuit to inflate, revealing Pabu.",2,2,14
Bolin,I'm a raft!,2,2,14
,"Cut to Desna and Eska as they cover their feet in ice and gracefully slide down the slope back to the team. Cut to an inflated Bolin following the twins, before he is stopped by Mako.",2,2,14
Bolin,"Uhhh, can someone please deflate me? [Eska deflates Bolin with three ice spikes.] Thank you.",2,2,14
Mako,"[Looking at their destroyed supplies.] Oh, great. There goes our equipment. Now what are we supposed to do?",2,2,14
Tonraq,There's only one thing to do. We have to turn back.,2,2,14
Unalaq,No! The solstice is tonight. And we're so close.,2,2,14
Tonraq,This mission is too dangerous. We're leaving.,2,2,14
Korra,"[Sternly.] No, Dad, you're leaving.",2,2,14
,"Cut to an aerial view of the team in the tundra. Cut to Mako and Tonraq, standing besides Tonraq's snowmobile.",2,2,14
Mako,"Don't worry sir, I'll keep an eye on Korra for you.",2,2,14
Tonraq,"Thank you, Mako. [They shake hands.]",2,2,14
,"Cut to an irritated Korra, as Tonraq speeds off on his snowmobile.",2,2,14
Unalaq,[To Korra.] Let's open this portal and lead your father and the entire Southern Water Tribe in the right direction. We don't have much time.,2,2,14
Korra,Then what are we waiting for?,2,2,14
,"Korra moves forward. Cut to an irritated Bolin, sat in the remains of his damaged snowmobile, which is being pulled by a camel yak ridden on by Eska and Desna. Cut to the entire team, before switching to Korra and Mako, who sit atop Naga.",2,2,14
Korra,"[Irritated.] So, what exactly were you and my dad talking about?",2,2,14
Mako,"Nothing, he was just worried about you, that's all.",2,2,14
Korra,"[Still irritated.] Y'know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.",2,2,14
Mako,There aren't any sides. We all just want to help however we can. You have to trust that we're here for you.,2,2,14
,Korra looks on to the South Pole.,2,2,14
Unalaq,We've arrived.,2,2,14
,"Cut to the interior of the South Pole, where there are a number of trees, their trunks covered in frozen ice.",2,2,14
Korra,Trees frozen in the ice.,2,2,14
Unalaq,[Walks up to Korra.] It's just like the sacred forest Tonraq destroyed in the North.,2,2,14
Korra,"So, what do I do?",2,2,14
Unalaq,"You must find your way to the heart of the forest where the dormant spirit portal lies. From here, you're on your own.",2,2,14
Mako,"Wait a second, there's no way she's going alone.",2,2,14
Bolin,"Yeah! If she goes, [Pabu emerges from Bolin's snowsuit.] we go, too!",2,2,14
Unalaq,The Avatar must go alone.,2,2,14
Korra,"But I don't have any connection with the spirits. In fact, it seems like they hate me.",2,2,14
Unalaq,"You have to believe in yourself, like I believe in you. [Korra turns away.] What is it?",2,2,14
Korra,I guess I'm just so used to people telling me how to do things that I forgot what it was like to have someone trust in me. [Korra smiles at her uncle.],2,2,14
Unalaq,"Korra, all the past Avatars live on inside of you. Let them guide you. Let them help you find the light in the dark. [Looks to the South Pole, a gaze which Korra follows.]",2,2,14
Korra,"[To Mako and Bolin.] Wait here, I'll be okay.",2,2,14
Mako,Good luck. [Pabu chitters.],2,2,14
,"Cut to Korra walking into the South Pole, while the rest of the team looks on. Cut to Korra trudging deeper into the frozen forest with a look of uncertainty and fear. A snake-like dark spirit nears Korra and screeches, causing her to turn around. In the distance, two dark spirits charge toward Korra, causing her to gasp. She turns and starts to run from them, but they manage to catch her and begin to wrap themselves around her body and legs. One of the spirits attempts to attack Korra, but she defends herself with a blast of fire, and frees herself from the spirit wrapped around her with airbending. The spirits charge back at Korra, but she stops them with an ice wall. Korra turns from the spirits, and finds herself in a large cave, a glowing dome positioned in the center.",2,2,14
Korra,[Approaching the glowing dome.] The spirit portal. Amazing.,2,2,14
,"Cut to a room in the Southern Air Temple where Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo are asleep. Jinora awakens and walks through the hall of statues in a daze. Cut to a close-up of her face, as she breaks free from her daze in shock and surprise, finding herself in front of the statue of an unknown Avatar.",2,2,14
Jinora,Whoa. What Avatar is this?,2,2,14
,"Cut back to the spirit portal, as Korra stands over the dome, staring into it.",2,2,14
Korra,The light in the dark.,2,2,14
,"Cut to Korra as she readies her stance, and subsequently punches the frozen portal with airbending, but to no effect. Korra tries to firebend at the portal, but still with no results.",2,2,14
Korra,Why isn't it opening?,2,2,14
,"Numerous dark spirits appear outside the hub and start attacking the roof, shocking Korra.",2,2,14
Korra,"[Continuously striking the portal with airbending.] Come on portal, open!",2,2,14
,"Cut to the spirits as they manage to break through the roof. They charge toward Korra and grab her around the waist. Cut to Korra, a scared look on her face, as the spirits continue to tangle themselves around her. They start pulling Korra up toward the roof of the cave as she repeatedly firebends at the spirit portal, but again her attacks have no effect. Korra is dragged further upward, as more spirits wrap themselves around her arms, preventing her from continuing her attacks. She enters the Avatar State, allowing her to momentarily break free and drop toward the portal, but the spirits still manage to keep a hold of her. Korra struggles to reach the portal, reaching desperately with her hand, and finally manages to touch it with her finger. An orange ring forms from where she touched the portal, and the ground cracks beneath her, creating a blast that tosses Korra aside and dispels the spirits. Cut to outside the South Pole, as a green beam of light rises and causes the southern lights to appear in the sky, while the Everstorm dissipates. Cut to Korra looking at the lights.",2,2,14
Korra,"The spirits, dancing in the sky.",2,2,14
,"Cut to Jinora at the Southern Air Temple, staring in surprise as the statue she found herself in front begins to glow. Cut back to the South Pole, as the team stare at the bright light that has emerged from the portal.",2,2,14
Mako,I can't believe it.,2,2,14
Bolin,It's beautiful. [Rubs his eyes.],2,2,14
,Cut to Unalaq looking ahead with a grin. Cut to Tonraq speeding away from the spirit forest. He stops his snowmobile and looks back at the lights.,2,2,14
Tonraq,[Proudly.] She did it.,2,2,14
,Cut to Korra walking out of the forest.,2,2,14
Bolin,"[Runs to Korra.] Hey, Korra, you're back. [To the rest of the group.] Hey, Korra's back! [He hugs Korra, but an ice wall separates them and brings Bolin back to face Eska.]",2,2,14
Eska,Why are you initiating physical contact with another woman?,2,2,14
,"Bolin looks at Eska with a weak fearful laugh, before Eska melts the ice wall.",2,2,14
Korra,[To Unalaq.] Everything you said was true.,2,2,14
Unalaq,"Avatar Korra, you have taken the first step in bringing balance back to the South, and soon the whole world.",2,2,14
Mako,[Hugging Korra.] You never cease to amaze me.,2,2,14
Korra,"Thanks. By the way, I'm really sorry for being a total pain. Things were really stressful and pretty confusing. It's hard being the Avatar.",2,2,14
Mako,[Jokingly.] It's harder being the Avatar's boyfriend. [Nudges Korra before they hug.],2,2,14
,"Cut to the team returning back to the Southern Water Tribe. Korra, Mako, and Unalaq look out to see a number of large battleships entering the harbor. Cut to troops marching in. Cut to the sea, where there are more battleships approaching the city.",2,2,14
Korra,[To Unalaq.] What are all your Northern troops doing here?,2,2,14
Unalaq,Opening the spirit portal was only the first step in getting the Southern Water Tribe back on its righteous path. There's more difficult work to be done before our two tribes are truly united.,2,2,14
,"Cut to Korra's unsure face, as she looks ahead at the troops.",2,2,14
,Fade to credits.,2,2,14
,"The scene begins at the tribal palace, where Northern troops are marching to Southern civilians, creating a commotion.",3,2,15
Northern soldier,"Everyone, clear the streets! Get back in your homes.",3,2,15
,"The civilians remain still and look at the troops with contempt. The Northern soldier gestures and two waterbenders bend ice barricades, separating the civilians. The troops continue marching. Cut to the harbor where waterbenders are forming ice walls around the docks, preventing ships from leaving. Cut to Korra and Unalaq.",3,2,15
Korra,"Uncle, why did you bring your troops down from the North?",3,2,15
Unalaq,"Now that you've opened the Southern portal, we need to protect it from the people who would do the spirits harm.",3,2,15
Korra,[Confidently.] I can protect it.,3,2,15
Unalaq,"I need you for something more important. There is another portal, in the North. Once you open it, spirits and man will be able to move freely between the North and the South in a matter of seconds.",3,2,15
Korra,"But, the solstice is over. How am I going to open it?",3,2,15
Unalaq,"The spiritual energy is much stronger in the North. And now that you've opened the Southern portal, your energy is stronger as well.",3,2,15
Korra,"[Smiling.] With both portals open, our tribes will be united again.",3,2,15
Unalaq,The world will be united again.,3,2,15
,"The setting changes to the Southern Air Temple, where Tenzin and Pema are relaxing. Kya is sitting on a rock, feeding lemurs.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"[Sips his tea.] Ahh, I haven't felt this at peace since- [Bumi jumps in, interrupting Tenzin, who looks in shock.] Aaand, it's over.",3,2,15
Bumi,"[Leaps onto rock, with his sister looking in shock.] Gooood morning, Universe.",3,2,15
Kya,"[Covering her eyes.] Bumi, please, cover yourself.",3,2,15
Bumi,"[To Tenzin.] Well, lookee here, ""Vacation Tenzin"" has finally decided to join us.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"Yes, he has. [Carries Rohan from his wife.] It's so nice to get to spend more time with my family. [To Rohan.] Isn't that right, my little Rohan? [Rohan smiles and coos. To Kya and Bumi.] And I've really enjoyed having you two around. Reminds me of all those great vacations we took as kids with Dad.",3,2,15
Kya,"Uhh, I think your memory's a little foggy. [Frowns.] Bumi and I weren't on those great vacations. It was always just you and Dad.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"[Thinking.] No, that can't be right. What about the time he took us to Kyoshi Island to ride the elephant koi?",3,2,15
Kya,"Nope, we weren't there.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"Hmm. Oh, remember Ember Island? Those amazing sand palaces we built on the beach.",3,2,15
Bumi,"You mean, you built? We never saw the place.",3,2,15
Tenzin,I could've sworn.,3,2,15
,Jinora and Meelo arrive at the scene on air scooters. Poki flies and lands on Meelo's head when both siblings land on solid ground.,3,2,15
Bumi,"Morning, kids! [Jinora and Meelo run to their uncle.]",3,2,15
Meelo,"Morning, Uncle Bumi! [Points to stomach.] Do you have a baby in there? [Kya, Tenzin and Pema laugh.]",3,2,15
Pema,Where's your sister?,3,2,15
Jinora,Who?,3,2,15
Pema,Ikki. About this tall. [Puts hand at her waist level.] Talks real fast. I'm sure you know her.,3,2,15
Jinora,[Uneasy.] Uhh ...,3,2,15
Meelo,"There was a lemur fight, but the bison told us not to worry because a giant was coming. Then we almost got eaten by a shark-squid! [Smiles widely.]",3,2,15
Bumi,[Terrified.] The shark-squid? He's here? It appears my old nemesis has found me. [Frowns.],3,2,15
Pema,"[Folds her hands in annoyance.] Jinora, were you and Meelo teasing your sister again?",3,2,15
Jinora,[Defensively.] I don't know. [Bows.] Maybe. [Hangs head down in shame.] Yes.,3,2,15
Meelo,She ran away.,3,2,15
Pema,"[Face reddens in anger.] Honestly, I don't know why you kids can't just get along!",3,2,15
Tenzin,"[Walks forward.] It's all right, dear, Ikki couldn't have gone far., [Hands back Rohan.] I'll find her.",3,2,15
Bumi,[Salutes.] Commander Bumi reporting for duty! Search-and-rescue missions are my specialty.,3,2,15
Kya,[Runs forward and holds her brothers' shoulders.] What do you say we all go together?,3,2,15
Tenzin,"Sure, I could use the help.",3,2,15
Bumi,"When I get back, we'll come out with a plan to take down that shark-squid once and for all!",3,2,15
Meelo,[Grins enthusiastically.] Yeah!,3,2,15
,"Cut back to a Southern Water Tribe village, followed by the interior of Tonraq's house where there is a meeting.",3,2,15
Tonraq,"Thank you for coming, everyone. I know these last few days have been very troubling. [The entire group looks at Varrick.]",3,2,15
Varrick,"[Helping himself to cookies.] Troubling? Troubling is when I get that itchy rash that won't go away, and Zhu Li's not around to scratch it. This is shocking. [Stands straight and drops cookies off plate before tossing the plate to the floor.] Nay, sickening! But these kale cookies? Opposite. [To Zhu Li.] Remind me to get the recipe later. [Zhu Li nods.]",3,2,15
Tonraq,"What's your point, Varrick?",3,2,15
Varrick,"My point is, [Helps himself to cookies once more.] Unalaq's already booted our chieftains out of their palace. How long before he starts telling us what kind of cookies [Tosses cookies away.] we can eat?",3,2,15
Zhu Li,Probably a couple of days.,3,2,15
Varrick,"[To Zhu Li.] Rhetorical question, Zhu Li, you gotta keep up. [To gathering.] Not to mention, I've got a cargo ship full of halibut that's rotting thanks to this harbor lockdown? [Enraged.] Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish? [Slams plate to floor.] Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.",3,2,15
Korra,Chief Unalaq is here to help the South. He wants to show us how to restore balance with the spirits so they'll stop attacking.,3,2,15
Varrick,"The only spirit I'm interested in restoring is our spirit of independence. Am I right, people? [Gathering agrees in anger.]",3,2,15
Korra,All Unalaq is trying to do is make our tribes unified again.,3,2,15
Varrick,"No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom! [Gathering agrees in anger.]",3,2,15
Korra,You want to start a war? Are you crazy?,3,2,15
Tonraq,"Unalaq started this, not us. [Korra scowls, he sighs.] I'm sorry, maybe you could speak with your uncle. Tell him how frustrated we all are. He'll listen to what the Avatar has to say. Do it for me?",3,2,15
Korra,I'll do it for the tribe. [Walks away and slams the door.],3,2,15
Varrick,"I cannot stop eating these things. [To Tonraq.] Look, we all know where this conflict is heading. We need to start preparing for war.",3,2,15
,"Cut to a sweating Bolin pulling a rickshaw. Desna and Eska are seated at the back, with Pabu in Desna's hand.",3,2,15
Eska,I will hate to leave this quaint tribe.,3,2,15
Desna,"Is that true, Eska?",3,2,15
Eska,"Of course not, Desna, I will not miss it at all. I hold immense dislike for the South. [Laughs awkwardly, which Desna follows, to Bolin.] Bolin, laugh at my humorous quip!",3,2,15
Bolin,"Yes, dear. [Forces laughter.] So-so funny. [Pabu yawns.]",3,2,15
,Bolin stops the rickshaw and runs to the side where he earthbends a small flight of stairs before gesturing for Eska to walk down.,3,2,15
Bolin,"[Holding Eska's hand while she descends the stairs.] You know, I'll be really sad when you have to leave. It's been really great getting to know you. [Chuckles lightly.] Really.",3,2,15
Eska,But you will be coming with me to the North. There we will live the rest of our lives together in icy bliss. [Walks away.] Foolish Bolin.,3,2,15
Bolin,[Sees Mako.] Mako! I'm so happy to see you! [Awkwardly hugs Mako.],3,2,15
Mako,"Uh, you all right, bro?",3,2,15
Bolin,"[Shakes head.] No! No, I'm not all right. I can't take anymore. Listen, I don't want to live in icy bliss with Eska! [Weeps.] Don't make me. Oh, please, please don't make me.",3,2,15
Mako,"Uh, hey, if you're that unhappy, just break up with her.",3,2,15
Bolin,Break up with her? You can do that?,3,2,15
Mako,Yeah. Guys do that all the time.,3,2,15
Bolin,How?,3,2,15
Mako,Just tell her you're not that into her anymore.,3,2,15
Bolin,"Oh, no, no, I don't think she'd like that.",3,2,15
Mako,[Holds Bolin's shoulder.] Ending a relationship is kind of like pulling off a blood-sucking leech. You just gotta rip it off and get it over with. You'll feel a lot better afterwards. Trust me.,3,2,15
Bolin,"Thanks, Mako. Whew. I'm lucky you're so good at breaking girls' hearts. [Jokingly.] Ha, Korra better watch out. [Mako scowls and folds his arms.] Oooh, no, it's just a-, uh, you kn-, uh, never mind.",3,2,15
,"Now inside of the Southern Water Tribe palace, Korra walks in to see Unalaq sitting on the throne.",3,2,15
Unalaq,Our next training sessions isn't until tomorrow.,3,2,15
Korra,I'm sorry to interrupt. It's about our conversation this morning.,3,2,15
Unalaq,Yes?,3,2,15
Korra,"I understand why you brought your troops here, but I'm afraid it's sending the wrong message.",3,2,15
Unalaq,Your father has been talking to you.,3,2,15
Korra,Not just him. Varrick too. There was a meeting at my parents' house. A lot of Southerners feel like their tribe is being invaded.,3,2,15
Unalaq,"I am their chief. I'm uniting, not invading.",3,2,15
Korra,"I know, but I'm just afraid if something doesn't change, there could be a civil war.",3,2,15
Unalaq,"If the Water Tribes were at war, the other nations would take sides. The dark spirits would thrive off this negative energy, and the world would be thrown into a battle between spirits and man. That would be catastrophic.",3,2,15
Korra,How do we stop it?,3,2,15
Unalaq,"We? No, Korra. [He rises from his throne.] This is a war only the Avatar can prevent.",3,2,15
Korra,[Unalaq walks toward Korra.] I'm usually the one starting fights. I don't know how to stop them from happening.,3,2,15
Unalaq,"As the Avatar, you must remain neutral in this conflict. You will naturally want to help your people, but showing favoritism will not help our tribes finds unity.",3,2,15
Korra,"Maybe Tenzin was right. [Korra looks down, discouraged.] Maybe I'm not ready to be the Avatar.",3,2,15
Unalaq,Tenzin lacked faith in you. [Unalaq places his hand on Korra's shoulder.] But I have no doubt that you will become the most admired Avatar the world has ever known.,3,2,15
Korra,"Thank you, Uncle.",3,2,15
,Cut to a snow-covered street where a group of four Northern soldiers are marching into view. The civilians glare at the soldiers hatefully. The soldiers glare at the civilians before being pelted by snowballs.,3,2,15
Northern soldier,Who threw those?,3,2,15
,"Camera pans to roof, showing children giggling. A Northern soldier waterbends and sends the children to the ground.",3,2,15
Northern soldier,"You hoodlums think you're tough, huh?",3,2,15
Southern civilian,Pick on a waterbender your own size!,3,2,15
,"Both civilians and soldiers waterbend, ready to attack.",3,2,15
Korra,[Running between both sides.] Stop!,3,2,15
Southern civilian,Tell these thugs to go back to the North. They're not welcome here anymore!,3,2,15
Northern soldier,These Southerners need to stay in line.,3,2,15
Korra,"Everyone, calm down. You're all part of the same tribe, start acting like it.",3,2,15
Southern civilian,[Angry.] You're taking their side? We thought you were one of us.,3,2,15
Korra,[Defensively.] I'm not taking anyone's side. [Is hit by a snowball to the head.] Hey!,3,2,15
Little girl,You're the worst Avatar ever!,3,2,15
Tonraq,"Everyone, walk away from this. They're not worth our trouble. Go back to your homes.",3,2,15
,Civilians drop their water and walk away. Soldiers follow suit.,3,2,15
Tonraq,"Korra, I- [Notices Korra is leaving.] Korra!",3,2,15
,Cut to the Southern Air Temple.,3,2,15
Tenzin,"Ikki! Ikki! Ikki? Ikki, where are you?",3,2,15
Bumi,"[Childlike voice.] Over here, Dad! [Laughs.] Just kidding. It's me!",3,2,15
,Tenzin groans in annoyance. Kya comes running up behind him.,3,2,15
Kya,There's no sign of her anywhere.,3,2,15
Tenzin,"Why would Ikki run off like this? Ah, it's probably my fault.",3,2,15
Kya,[Crosses arms.] Probably.,3,2,15
Tenzin,Excuse me?,3,2,15
Kya,"I'm guessing you've been so busy with your [Makes air quotes.] ""duty"" to Republic City that you forgot about your duty to your kids.",3,2,15
Bumi,"[Laughs.] ""Duty.""",3,2,15
Kya,"[Places hands in her sides as she turns to Bumi; annoyed.] What are you, five years old?",3,2,15
Tenzin,"Kya, you're right. I haven't been spending enough time with them. I wish I could be as good a father as Dad was to us.",3,2,15
Kya,"Tenzin, your problem is you're exactly like Dad. He was so focused on saving the world and doing his duty, [To Bumi.] don't laugh, that he never had time for us.",3,2,15
Tenzin,Dad was under a lot of pressure.,3,2,15
Bumi,"He always had time for you, though, [Pinches Tenzin's cheek, which makes him flinch.] his precious little airbender.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"[Pushing Bumi aside.] Dad loved us all equally. Besides, it all happened a long time ago. Why are we even talking about this?",3,2,15
Kya,"Because you seem to have some grandiose delusion that we had a perfect, happy-go-lucky childhood. Guess what. We didn't!",3,2,15
Tenzin,We need to keep moving if we want to find Ikki before dark.,3,2,15
Kya,"[Mockingly.] See what he's doing there, Bumi? Classic airbender technique. Cutting and running when things get tough!",3,2,15
Tenzin,Uch.,3,2,15
Bumi,[Teasingly.] Yeah. Did Dad teach you that move?,3,2,15
,"Cut back to the Southern Water Tribe, where Korra rides atop Naga and approaches Mako.",3,2,15
Mako,"How was your day, sweetie?",3,2,15
Korra,"[Sarcastically.] Oh, fabulous. [Scowls.] My tribe's about to go to war, and I'm supposed to stop it, but will anyone listen to me? No! And I didn't ask for my father's help. Can't he just let me be the Avatar?",3,2,15
Mako,"Uh, do you want advice, or am I just supposed to listen? I'm still not clear on that.",3,2,15
Korra,Ugh. I'm sorry. My dad just gets me all worked up.,3,2,15
Mako,"How about you take a break from all this Avatar stuff, and we go out for a quiet dinner. Just the two of us.",3,2,15
,"Korra grins, before the scene changes to a dining area where Korra gives a bored expression, while the camera pans to Mako, who gives the same expression. Cut to the opposite side where Desna and Eska are seated. Camera pans to Bolin.",3,2,15
Bolin,"[Laughs awkwardly.] Isn't this fun, huh? We never get to spend enough time together, just the ... five of us. So fun.",3,2,15
Eska,Excuse us while we retrieve more sustenance. [Both twins walk away.],3,2,15
Bolin,You guys gotta save me.,3,2,15
Mako,"I though you were breaking up with her. What happened to ""ripping off the leech""?",3,2,15
Bolin,"I tried! But anytime I bring up the subject, she threatens to freeze me in a block of ice and feed me to dolphin piranhas!",3,2,15
Mako,So it was more like you tugged at the leech.,3,2,15
Bolin,"Yes, over and over and over, but it won't come off. Why didn't you warn me your cousin had the power to reach into my heart and crush my soul with her bare hands.",3,2,15
Korra,"Uh, 'cause I thought it was pretty obvious?",3,2,15
Bolin,"No, no, not to me it wasn't. I'm very bad at reading people. You should know that by now. [Sobs.] Oh, man. Oh! Do something, Avatar!",3,2,15
,"Cut back to the Southern Air Temple, where Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin are walking. It is getting dark and Tenzin is holding a lantern.",3,2,15
Bumi,"You know, this reminds me of a search-and-rescue mission I commanded years ago in the mountains outside of Ba Sing Se.",3,2,15
Tenzin,[Groans.] Here we go.,3,2,15
Bumi,"For five days we scoured the beast of a mountain, fighting our ways through blizzards, sandstorms, and three typhoons. Finally, we found the men huddled in a cave, seconds from death. With no time to lose, I piled all twelve of those poor souls on my back and single-handedly carried them down the mountain to safety.",3,2,15
Tenzin,[Snaps.] And how exactly is that supposed to help us find Ikki?,3,2,15
Bumi,"It was supposed to inspire you. Clearly, you know nothing about being a leader of men. That's probably why the Avatar fired you.",3,2,15
Tenzin,I'm sick of your far-fetched tales. Three typhoons?,3,2,15
Bumi,"Well, I may have thrown in an extra typhoon or two for dramatic effect, but-",3,2,15
Kya,Quit arguing and bring that lantern over here. I found footprints.,3,2,15
,Tenzin walks up to Kya and follows the footprints with his lantern.,3,2,15
Tenzin,"Come on! [Runs down the path, following the footprints.]",3,2,15
Bumi,"No, follow me! This will get us down fifty times faster. [Leaps onto rocks alongside the waterfall.]",3,2,15
Kya,"Bumi, it's pitch black and the rocks are slippery. You're going to hurt yourself.",3,2,15
Bumi,"Come on, you wimps! If I can do it, it should be no problem for a couple of benders.",3,2,15
Kya,Fine.,3,2,15
,"Kya descends the waterfall using waterbending to hold her. Tenzin leaps from ledge to ledge, using airbending to boost his leap. Both soon overtake their older brother, who grumbles.",3,2,15
Kya,"[Teasingly.] You were right, Bumi! That was faster!",3,2,15
Tenzin,"At least fifty times faster, by my calculations. [Chuckles with his sister.]",3,2,15
Bumi,"[Grumbling.] Oh, so Tenzin's the funny guy now.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"If you need an airlift down, just say the word.",3,2,15
Bumi,"Bah, I don't need your help. I've got everything under control. [Slips and falls.] Agh!",3,2,15
Tenzin,[Shocked and worried.] Bumi!,3,2,15
,"Cut to the Southern Water Tribe, where Korra is riding back to her home. She enters and finds her mother seated.",3,2,15
Korra,Did Dad send you to talk to me?,3,2,15
Senna,"Your father doesn't know I'm here. [Korra sits beside her.] Korra, what's going on between you two?",3,2,15
Korra,Ask Dad. [Looks away.],3,2,15
Senna,"I've tried, but he won't talk about it. Honey, it breaks my heart to see our family being torn apart like this.",3,2,15
Korra,You want to know what's been going on? I found out Dad's been lying to me my whole life. Unalaq told me everything; how Dad and Tenzin kept me trapped down here while I trained; how Dad got banished from the North.,3,2,15
Senna,"So, the truth is out.",3,2,15
Korra,You knew? And you never said anything.,3,2,15
Senna,"We were trying to keep our family together, to give you a normal childhood.",3,2,15
Korra,"I never wanted a normal childhood. All I ever wanted to be was the Avatar. But everyone keeps holding me back, even my own parents! Unalaq's the only one who believes in me.",3,2,15
Senna,"That's not true, Korra.",3,2,15
Korra,"No? Then why is everyone in the South turning against me, when all I'm trying to do is help them?",3,2,15
Senna,The problems between the North and the South started long before you were born. You can't expect to undo them in a day.,3,2,15
Korra,So I should just sit back and let the Water Tribes go to war?,3,2,15
Senna,"No, but this situation might be out of your control. Varrick's been plotting a rebellion against Unalaq. He asked your father to join, and-",3,2,15
Korra,[Stands up.] Dad is part of a rebellion?,3,2,15
Senna,"I don't know, but I don't want you getting caught in the middle of it.",3,2,15
Korra,"It's too late, Mom. I'm already in the middle of it. [Leaves the house.]",3,2,15
Senna,[Runs out to door.] Korra!,3,2,15
,"Cut to the interior of the palace, where Korra runs in.",3,2,15
Korra,"Uncle! [Stops, and notices Northern troops tied up and unconscious.] Oh, no. Uncle? [Runs and stops at a corner and watches a masked rebel carrying an unconscious Unalaq while three others stand guard.] Dad? [Runs to the rebel.] Dad, don't do this.",3,2,15
Rebel,"Turn around, Avatar, and pretend you didn't see anything.",3,2,15
Korra,"No. Leave Unalaq and go. I'll tell him I tried to stop you, but you escaped. We can still avoid a war.",3,2,15
Rebel,"No, we can't.",3,2,15
,"The rebel traps Korra within an ice wall while they escape. Korra punches a gap within her enclosure and pursues the rebels. While the rebels were running down a flight of stairs, Korra freezes the handrails and slides down in front of them.",3,2,15
Rebel,Get him out of here!,3,2,15
,"The rebel leader runs away. Korra tries to follow, but is blocked by an ice wall.",3,2,15
Korra,We're all part of the same tribe. I don't wanna hurt you.,3,2,15
,"The rebels prepare to attack Korra, but she dodges their offenses. Korra leaps up and grabs a banner while evade the rebel's offenses. She runs up a pillar and tosses the banner against two rebels, using airbending to ensnare them. Korra continues dodging the remaining rebels' offenses and grabs the rope of one of the rebels and kicks another rebel, slamming him unconscious on the staircase. She ties the rope around the rebel's wrist and swings him to a pillar, knocking him out. Korra runs out of the palace to see the rebel leader leaving.",3,2,15
Korra,"Dad, stop! [Waterbends at the snowmobile, causing it to change course and crash.] Why did you do this, Dad? [Removes the rebel's hood, revealing him to not be Tonraq.] What? Who are you? Where's my father?",3,2,15
Rebel leader,"He wouldn't help us. He's a traitor, just like you.",3,2,15
,"Unalaq awakens. Cut back to the palace, where the rebels were led away in handcuffs.",3,2,15
Unalaq,Thank you for saving my life.,3,2,15
Korra,I'm just glad I got here in time.,3,2,15
Unalaq,Find Varrick. I want him to freeze in prison with the rest of these traitors. [Troops lead rebels away.],3,2,15
Korra,"Wait, you can't just lock them away. That will only make the South angrier.",3,2,15
Unalaq,You want them to go free?,3,2,15
Korra,No. But let them stand trial for what they did. Every Water Tribe citizen deserves that right.,3,2,15
Unalaq,[Softens.] Very well. I will respect the Avatar's wishes in this matter.,3,2,15
Korra,"[Smiles.] Thank you, Uncle.",3,2,15
,"Cut back to the Southern Air Temple, where Kya is healing a dazed Bumi.",3,2,15
Kya,I told you those rocks were slippery. You're lucky you didn't kill yourself.,3,2,15
Bumi,"You done with the lecture, Mom?",3,2,15
Kya,"Oh, grow up! You haven't changed one bit since we were kids. You're still trying to prove you can do everything a bender can. Well, you can't. Deal with it.",3,2,15
Bumi,"And you're not our mother. You don't get to tell me what I can and can't do. Deal with that. [Kya stops waterbending, causing the water to splash onto Bumi.] Ugh.",3,2,15
Kya,Good luck healing yourself with your special nonbending powers.,3,2,15
Bumi,"[Shakes water off head.] Hey, hey, back me up here, Tenzin.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"Kya's right. You're the oldest of us, but you always acted like the youngest. I had to become the responsible one.",3,2,15
Kya,You think you're the responsible one? [Approaches Tenzin.] Where were you after Dad died and Mom was all alone? Because I was the only one who packed up and moved my whole life to be with her.,3,2,15
Tenzin,"Sure, after years of flitting around the world, trying to find yourself. It was time for you to settle down somewhere. [Agitatedly.] You two have no idea how it feels to have the future of an entire culture on your shoulders.",3,2,15
Bumi,"[Sarcastically.] Oh, boo-hoo. Must've been real hard for you, flying around the world with Dad, riding elephant koi all day.",3,2,15
Tenzin,"Oh, so that's what this is all about.",3,2,15
Kya,That's what it's always been about. You think you're some savior who has to carry on Dad's legacy.,3,2,15
Tenzin,Who else is going to do it?,3,2,15
Kya,How about all of us?,3,2,15
Bumi,"Yeah, we're Aang's kids too.",3,2,15
Kya,We never should have come on this vacation.,3,2,15
Bumi,I couldn't agree more.,3,2,15
Tenzin,"[Agitated.] Well, I didn't want you to come in the first place. I can't be around you two right now. Go back to the temple and see if Ikki returned. I'll keep looking out here.",3,2,15
Bumi,[Snaps.] Fine.,3,2,15
Kya,[Snaps.] Fine.,3,2,15
Tenzin,Fine.,3,2,15
,"Kya and Bumi walk back to the air temple, leaving Tenzin alone as he continues the path. Cut to the Southern Water Tribe village where Korra rides back to her home and opens the door to see her parents eating. Tonraq and Senna look up to her, smiling.",3,2,15
Korra,Is it okay if I come in?,3,2,15
Senna,Of course. We heard what happened. Are you okay?,3,2,15
Korra,[Tears up and hugs her father.] I'm so glad you weren't there. I don't know what I would've done.,3,2,15
Tonraq,"I had no idea how far Varrick was willing to go. My brother and I have our differences, but I would never attack him.",3,2,15
Korra,I'm sorry for thinking you had anything to do with the rebels. And for all the pain I've caused you and Mom.,3,2,15
Tonraq,"I'm the one who should apologize. After I saw the Southern Lights return, I was so proud of you. I never should've held you back.",3,2,15
Senna,"When your father and I found each other, all we wanted was to live a simple life and raise a family. But, then we discovered you were the Avatar, and simple was over. We knew one day the world would need you, and you wouldn't need us anymore.",3,2,15
Korra,"Mom, Dad, [Hugs her parents.] of course I still need you.",3,2,15
Tonraq,[Unalaq walks in.] We weren't expecting you.,3,2,15
Unalaq,"[Four soldiers enter the room.] Tonraq, Senna, you are under arrest and will stand trial.",3,2,15
Tonraq,Trial? For what?,3,2,15
Unalaq,For conspiring to assassinate me.,3,2,15
,Cut to Korra and her parents looking in shock and disbelief.,3,2,15
,Fades to credits.,3,2,15
,"In the Southern Water Tribe, outside of Tonraq and Senna's house, Korra's parents are being loaded into a prison truck. Korra and her parents exchange worried gazes.",4,2,16
Korra,[To Unalaq.] You're making a mistake. [Prison truck leaves.],4,2,16
Unalaq,"I wish it hadn't come to this. But your parents held meeting with the rebels, right here in their home.",4,2,16
Korra,[In disbelief.] I can't believe you're doing this to your own family.,4,2,16
Unalaq,"Rest assured, I've appointed Judge Hotah to oversee the trial. He is the most fair and honorable man I know.",4,2,16
Korra,"Uncle, my parents had nothing to do with the men who attacked you.",4,2,16
Unalaq,I'm sure you're right. So we should have nothing to worry about.,4,2,16
Korra,[Unsure.] I hope so.,4,2,16
,"The scenes cuts to inside of Varrick's mansion, where Asami, Mako, and Bolin are waiting.",4,2,16
Asami,Where's Varrick? We should've closed our deal an hour ago.,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Responds to Asami while lounging on a couch.] Would you relax? This place is great. [Closes his eyes in delight.] And the best part about it, [Opens his eyes and smiles at them.] Eska doesn't know I'm here. [Pabu and Bolin look to the door.]",4,2,16
,"Eska, Desna, and several Northern Water Tribe soldiers enter the room.",4,2,16
Bolin,"[Stands up in shock.] Ee-yah. [To Eska.] I wasn't hiding. Hey, hey-hey, hey.",4,2,16
Eska,I'm not on the hunt for you. [Slightly narrows her eyes.] Currently.,4,2,16
Desna,We search for Varrick. Our father wishes him to stand trial.,4,2,16
Asami,What did he do?,4,2,16
Eska,"He is a traitor to the Water Tribe, along with our aunt and uncle.",4,2,16
Asami,What?,4,2,16
Mako,Korra's parents were arrested?,4,2,16
Desna,Yes. Your powers of deduction are impressive.,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Points to Mako with his thumb.] Yeah, he's a cop.",4,2,16
Northern guardsman,[To the twins.] Varrick's not here.,4,2,16
Eska,"Very well. Desna, let us continue our search elsewhere. [To Bolin.] Boyfriend! Bow to me when I exit.",4,2,16
Bolin,"[Bolin kneels and bows to Eska.] Yes, yes, my sweet koala otter.",4,2,16
Eska,You are so cute when you grovel.,4,2,16
,"Eska leaves, behind Desna and the soldiers.",4,2,16
Asami,[To Bolin.] Don't let her treat you that way. Stand up for yourself.,4,2,16
Bolin,"I tried to break up with her, but Mako gave me terrible advice. Thank you, Mako. [Bolin crosses his arms.]",4,2,16
Mako,"Wait, how are your girl problems my fault?",4,2,16
Asami,"Bolin, you need to be honest with her. Tell her how you really feel.",4,2,16
Varrick,"[To Bolin, his voice greatly muffled.] Honesty is for fools, kid. [The trio widen their eyes in surprise and looks around.]",4,2,16
Bolin,Varrick?,4,2,16
Varrick,"[Voice still muffled.] If you want to ditch this girl, then make yourself scarce. Disappear, like I did.",4,2,16
Asami,[To Varrick.] Where are you?,4,2,16
Varrick,"[To Asami, muffled.] Somewhere Unalaq will never find me. [His head appears from the stuffed platypus bear's mouth.] Inside Ping-Ping! How we doin'?",4,2,16
Mako,The coast is clear. You can come out.,4,2,16
Varrick,"No way, mister. Not until I know it's absolutely 157% safe. [Zhu Li's hand appears in the bear's mouth with a cup of tea, Varrick takes it and responds.] Ah! Thank you, Zhu Li.",4,2,16
Asami,Your assistant's in there too?,4,2,16
Varrick,"[To Asami.] Zhu Li never leaves my side. [Varrick takes a sip of the tea, but spits it out in disgust. To Zhu Li irritatingly with his vein shown on his head.] Yuck! Pyugh! Pyuck! You forgot the honey! [Camera pans to the bear's center mass.]",4,2,16
Zhu Li,"[Muffled.] Sorry, sir. There isn't any in here. [Camera pans back to Varrick's face.]",4,2,16
Varrick,No honey? We're in a bear for crying out loud!,4,2,16
Mako,[To all.] I'm gonna go see how Korra's doing. [Mako walks out.],4,2,16
Varrick,"Bolin, I got a little something for you 'round back. [The platypus bear's tail lifts up, and a stack of paper yuans falls out.]",4,2,16
Bolin,[Bolin picks up the money.] Wow!,4,2,16
Varrick,"Now listen up. Unalaq's rigged this trial, no doubt about it. So I need you to make sure my trusty rebels stay out of prison.",4,2,16
Bolin,"[Stands, holds up the wad in his hand.] What's the money for?",4,2,16
Varrick,"[Varrick blurts out with a laugh.] Bribery, of course! There's always someone willing to look the other way for a few yuans.",4,2,16
Bolin,"I think I catch your drift, Varrick-bear.",4,2,16
,"Cut to the Southern Air Temple, where Tenzin continues his search.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"Ikki! Ikki, where are you? Shoo! [Two ring-tailed winged lemurs land on Tenzin, annoying him.] Go bother someone else. You two are worse than Kya and Bumi.",4,2,16
Ikki,"Okay, everybody here?",4,2,16
Tenzin,"Ikki! Oh, thank goodness.",4,2,16
Ikki,"[Tenzin walks into a cave.] Juniper Lightning bug, paws off the table! [Cut to Ikki seated around a raised platform with four other sky bison calves.] This is going to be a civilized breakfast. Daddy always says a blessing before we eat, so ... [A calf stumbles over another.] be quiet and listen up! [The two calves look at Ikki. Cut to Tenzin running to the entrance, but stops.] We are thankful for this super yummy food and for being the best-est new friends in the world. [Tenzin smiles.] But we are most thankful because Meelo and Jinora aren't here, [Tenzin is saddened.] because they stink. [Tenzin frowns. Cut to Tenzin's point of view, where Ikki turns to see her father.] Oh! Hi, Daddy. I guess you found me. Do I have to go now?",4,2,16
Tenzin,"Actually, is there room for one more?",4,2,16
Ikki,"Uh, sure. You can sit next to Blueberry Spicehead.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"[Sits down, while the calf looks at Tenzin.] Nice to meet you, Blueberry Spicehead.",4,2,16
Ikki,"And that's Princess Rainbow, and that's Twinkle Starchild, and that's Juniper Lightning Bug. They're my new brothers and sisters.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"New ones, huh? Can they be my new brothers and sisters too?",4,2,16
Ikki,"Maybe, but only if they say it's okay. [Leans in to the bison calf sitting to her left, and starts to listen to it.] Uh-huh, uh-huh. No, no, he's nice. They say it's okay.",4,2,16
,"The camera pulls back from a wide shot of the tea party. Cut to the Southern Water Tribe palace, followed by the interior of the courtroom. Cut to the rebels and Korra's parents, who will stand trial, before switching to a worried Korra and Mako. Bolin sits next to Asami.",4,2,16
Bolin,"We're good to go. I gave all the money to some guys over there. I told them to ""take care of it"", and then I winked. [Pleased with himself, he winks at them and laughs confidently.] Pretty sure they got the message.",4,2,16
,"Cut to two shady-looking characters, who count the money with a smile and smile back at Bolin with thumbs up. Bolin returns the gesture while the gavel is hammered, and Asami facepalms.",4,2,16
Law clerk,"This trial will now come to order! Judge Hotah presiding. [Cut to Hotah, a serious-looking old man, settling into the judge's chair at the center of the dais.]",4,2,16
Bolin,[Realization.] Man! I should have paid him!,4,2,16
Asami,"[Annoyed.] Yeah, you think? [Bolin looks worried.]",4,2,16
Unalaq,"I was asleep in my chambers when the rebels attacked. They overpowered me, and the next thing I remember was waking up in the snow after Avatar Korra had saved me.",4,2,16
Hotah,"According to Unalaq's testimony, you attended a meeting where Varrick tried to incite a civil war. Is that true?",4,2,16
Korra,Yes.,4,2,16
Hotah,And where these men present at that meeting?,4,2,16
Korra,"Well, yes, but -",4,2,16
Hotah,And where exactly did this meeting take place?,4,2,16
Bolin,Objection!,4,2,16
Hotah,Quiet down out there! I'll ask you one more time. Where did the meeting happen?,4,2,16
Korra,My parents' house.,4,2,16
Hotah,And who led this meeting?,4,2,16
Bolin,"Your honor, if I may?",4,2,16
Hotah,May what?,4,2,16
Bolin,May I ... declare a mistrial?,4,2,16
Hotah,"[To Bolin.] Sit down! [To Korra.] Varrick and your father led the meeting, didn't they?",4,2,16
Korra,[Defensively.] My parents are innocent!,4,2,16
Hotah,I've heard all I need to. I'll return shortly with my decision.,4,2,16
,Judge Hotah leaves. Korra spouts a worried expression. Cut to a room where Eska is standing and Bolin enters.,4,2,16
Bolin,"Hey there, Eska, I was wondering if we could talk.",4,2,16
Eska,I grant you permission to speak freely.,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Nervously.] Oh, good, because I just need to be honest with you. You know, when we first met, there was this crazy spark. But I'm starting to feel like that spark is fading.",4,2,16
Eska,I agree. It is as if a great chasm has formed between us and nothing can bridge it.,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Relieved.] Oh! Oh, yes! I'm so glad you understand!",4,2,16
Eska,"Nothing, that is, except marriage. [Eska shows Bolin a betrothal necklace with a skull pendant, while sporting a menacing grin and widened eyes. Cut to Bolin's eyes going wide with fear, as she promptly ties it around his neck before dragging him toward her by the necklace.] We will wed at sunset. You may express your joy through tears.",4,2,16
Bolin,"[Cries.] Oh, no, I can't - [Coughing as he is being dragged away by the necklace.] This is really tight.",4,2,16
,Cut back to the courtroom. All the defendants are now standing before Judge Hotah.,4,2,16
Hotah,"Senna, please step forward. [Senna steps forward and looks worriedly at her husband.] I have found you ... innocent. You are free to go.",4,2,16
Senna,[A guard removes her handcuffs and she runs to Korra to hug her.] Korra!,4,2,16
Hotah,"On the charge of treason, you are all found ... guilty. The punishment for this crime ... is death.",4,2,16
,"Cut to a shocked Mako and Asami, who stand up. Cut to Korra and Senna, who look on with utter shock and disbelief. Cut to Tonraq, who closes his eyes and bows. Cut back to the courtroom, where Hotah leaves.",4,2,16
Korra,"You can't do this! [Hotah glances at Korra.] You take their lives, and I'll take yours! [Hotah stops and his eyes widen in shock.]",4,2,16
Unalaq,"Korra, calm down. I'll talk to him. [To Hotah.] I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider. Show these men and my brother mercy.",4,2,16
Hotah,"Very well. I'll change their punishment. Your lives will be spared, but you will live them out in prison. [Rebels and Tonraq heave a sigh of relief.]",4,2,16
Korra,"Thank you, Uncle.",4,2,16
,"Cut to the cave where Tenzin and Ikki are in. Ikki plays with the bison calves by bending a ball of air which they chase, while Tenzin is petting another calf.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"You like that, don't you, Blueberry Spicehead? [Cooing.] Yes, you do. [Calf snuggles against Tenzin.] You know, I could get used to it here. No one's yelling at me or telling me I'm delusional.",4,2,16
Ikki,We should have Uncle Bumi and Aunt Kya come visit. I bet they'd like it too.,4,2,16
Tenzin,Let's not. They'll only spoil our good mood.,4,2,16
Ikki,"What do you mean? Aunt Kya is super nice and pretty and always asks me how I'm feeling, and Uncle Bumi is, like, the funniest person in the world.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"But what about Meelo? He's hilarious too, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth. And Jinora can be so sweet and gentle.",4,2,16
Ikki,"[Scowls.] And mean. And bossy. [Saddened.] Being part of a family is hard, huh, Daddy?",4,2,16
Tenzin,I couldn't agree with you more.,4,2,16
,"The calf which Tenzin is petting awakens and flies out of the cave with its siblings, where they reunite with their parents.",4,2,16
Ikki,"But, I guess the nice part about a family is they'll always be there for you. Even though [Cut to a calf biting its sibling's ear and both tug before chasing each other.] Twinkle Starchild and Princess Rainbow fight, they still love each other.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"That's very wise of you, Ikki.",4,2,16
Ikki,"We should probably head back, huh?",4,2,16
Tenzin,I suppose. We can't hide in this cave forever. [Holds Ikki's hand.],4,2,16
Ikki,"Don't worry, Daddy. We'll come back and visit Blueberry Spicehead. I know you really bonded with her.",4,2,16
Tenzin,"Yes, I'd like that.",4,2,16
,"Cut to an exterior of the prison, cut to Tonraq's cell which Korra and Senna enter.",4,2,16
Senna,"Honey, are you all right?",4,2,16
Tonraq,I'm fine.,4,2,16
Korra,"[Determined.] Good, let's bust you out of here right now.",4,2,16
Tonraq,"Korra, no. Saving me would start a war. If fighting were to break out, the North would crush the South. I'll be all right. Just promise me you won't do anything rash.",4,2,16
Korra,Fine. I promise.,4,2,16
,"Cut to the land where Korra and her parents' house is located. Cut to the interior, where Senna is standing before the sink, crying. Korra is watching her from a distance, before approaching her mother.",4,2,16
Korra,"[Consoling.] It's okay, Mom.",4,2,16
Senna,I-I hate feeling so helpless. [Wipes off tears.],4,2,16
Korra,[Cut to a close-up of Korra's saddened face.] I know. [The camera zooms in on her face as she gives an angry and determined look.],4,2,16
,"Cut to a cliff where a Satomobile is being driven. Cut to the interior, where Hotah is driving the car. He glances in his review mirror. A close-up of the mirror reveals Korra riding Naga behind his car, gaining on him fast. His eyes widen in surprise. A quick close-up of Hotah's foot shows him flooring the gas pedal. Korra and Naga, however, manage to catch up and knock the Satomobile, causing it to lose control and slamming to the side of the cliff. Naga knocks off the door, while Hotah looks in fear. Korra pulls him up and slams him against the side of the Satomobile.",4,2,16
Hotah,[Terrified.] What do you want?,4,2,16
Korra,[Threatening.] It's not about what I want. It's about what Naga wants. [Naga growls in anger.] And she'd like you to let my father out of prison.,4,2,16
Hotah,"I-I'm sorry, but there is nothing I can do. I was just following Unalaq's orders.",4,2,16
Korra,[Enraged.] What are you talking about?,4,2,16
Hotah,I-I've said too much.,4,2,16
Korra,"[Throws Hotah into Naga's mouth.] Unless you wanna be Naga's afternoon snack, you'd better keep talking.",4,2,16
Hotah,I-I've worked for your uncle for years! He said he needed everyone to think the trial was fair.,4,2,16
Korra,So Unalaq told you what to say?,4,2,16
Hotah,Yes! Every word.,4,2,16
Korra,Then why did he have you free my mother and change your sentence?,4,2,16
Hotah,He's trying to keep you on his side. But he also wants your father out of the way. Just like when he got your father banished.,4,2,16
Korra,"[Close-up on Korra's shocked face.] What do you mean, ""he got my father banished""?",4,2,16
Hotah,Nothing!,4,2,16
Korra,[The camera zooms in on Korra's furious expression. Menacingly.] Keep talking.,4,2,16
,"Cut to the Air Temple Sanctuary, where Bumi is looking at a statue of his father, Avatar Aang.",4,2,16
Bumi,"Uh ... Hey there, Dad. You're looking well. [Apologetically.] Look, uh, I'm sorry I didn't turn out to be an airbender like you hoped. But I've tried my best to keep the world safe. Hope I made you proud.",4,2,16
Kya,"[Panning to Kya standing at the entrance.] Of course he'd be proud of you, Bumi.",4,2,16
Bumi,"Kya! I-I was just, [Wipes Aang's statue.] uh ... cleaning off Dad's statue. [Chuckles and coughs.] It's so dusty in here.",4,2,16
Kya,Come here. [Hugs Bumi.],4,2,16
Bumi,"[Hugs back his sister.] Thanks, Kya. You always know when I need a hug.",4,2,16
,Cut to Varrick's mansion.,4,2,16
Korra,Unalaq's a liar and a traitor!,4,2,16
Varrick,I've been trying to tell you that from the get-go.,4,2,16
Mako,What happened?,4,2,16
Korra,"I found out the truth about my dad's banishment. Unalaq hired the barbarians to attack their tribe. Then he told them to hide in the spirit forest, knowing my dad would go after them.",4,2,16
Mako,Unalaq wanted your dad out of the way so he could become chief. It was a setup.,4,2,16
Korra,Just like the whole trial. I can't believe I trusted him. I'm busting my father and the rebels out of jail. I need your help.,4,2,16
Mako,"If you do this, there's no going back.",4,2,16
Korra,I know. Will you help me or not?,4,2,16
Mako,"Of course, I'll help.",4,2,16
Asami,Me too.,4,2,16
Varrick,[Raises Ping-Ping's paw.] Count me in!,4,2,16
,"The door opens, revealing both Bolin and Pabu dressed up like Eska. Bolin's hair stands up awkwardly.",4,2,16
Mako,I don't even want to know.,4,2,16
Asami,So I'm guessing the breakup with Eska didn't go well?,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Sarcastically smiling.] No, no, the honesty thing worked out great. So great she decided we should [Scowls in anger.] get married!",4,2,16
Asami,Sorry.,4,2,16
Korra,[Slightly amused.] I'm pretty sure the guy is supposed to give the girl the betrothal necklace.,4,2,16
Bolin,I guess Eska didn't get the memo.,4,2,16
Varrick,"Look, the only way to deal with crazy women is to lie big and leave fast. Lucky for you, Varrick's got your back. Now, gather 'round Ping-Ping. Let's talk plan.",4,2,16
,"Cut to the prison. A guard is patrolling the interior, where an earthbending move causes him to fall into a trench. Sparks fly out of the trench as the guard is electrocuted. Cut to the trench, where the unconscious guard is lying, while Asami, Mako, and Korra climb up the trench.",4,2,16
Korra,"My dad's in there. [She opens the cell door, only to find it deserted.] Where is he?",4,2,16
Unalaq,"I'm sorry, Korra. You'll never see your father again.",4,2,16
Korra,Where's my father?,4,2,16
Unalaq,On a ship headed to the Northern Tribe. He'll serve out his sentence there.,4,2,16
Korra,Bring him back. Or I'm taking you out and the rest of your army.,4,2,16
Unalaq,"Remember who you are. As the Avatar, you cannot threaten war. You must remain neutral, or our tribes will never find unity.",4,2,16
Korra,"You don't want unity. You want power. You've always been jealous of my father, haven't you? You got him banished so you could become chief, and I bet it just killed you to learn he was the Avatar's father. No wonder you kept trying to take me away from him.",4,2,16
Unalaq,All I've ever wanted is to help you realize your destiny.,4,2,16
Korra,"Well, I don't want your help anymore.",4,2,16
Unalaq,"If you start a war, the dark spirits will annihilate the South. And even I will be powerless to stop them.",4,2,16
Korra,"I'm done being manipulated by you. You're going to bring my father back, then you and your troops will return to the North. [Turns away.]",4,2,16
Unalaq,And why would I do that?,4,2,16
Korra,Because you still need me to open the Northern portal.,4,2,16
Unalaq,"No, I don't. You've served your purpose.",4,2,16
,"An enraged Korra throws three fire blasts at her uncle, which Unalaq neutralizes with waterbending. Unalaq throws an arc and a blast at Korra. Korra manages to stop the frozen arc, but is pushed off by the frozen blast. Mako assists Korra with a fire kick. Unalaq manages to dodge the kick and pushes Mako off with a water blast to the face. Unalaq throws another water blast at his niece, but she manages to catch the blast and pushes his against the wall with an air blast.",4,2,16

Korra,Let's go.,4,2,16
,"Team Avatar exits the prison, while Unalaq looks on. Cut to the Southern Tribe city, where Bolin is ""guiding"" Ping-Ping with a leash, while Pabu sits on the platypus bear. They are subsequently stopped by a solider. Cut to Varrick's point of view, as he opens Ping-Ping's mouth.",4,2,16
Northern soldier,You have a license for that animal?,4,2,16
Bolin,"[Nervously.] Uh, you fellas seen a traveling circus come through here?",4,2,16
Varrick,"[Whispers.] Zhu Li, do the thing.",4,2,16

Bolin,Where's your dad?,4,2,16
Korra,On a ship headed north. Think we can catch up to it?,4,2,16
Varrick,"Sure, once you get us past our friends from the North.",4,2,16
,The scene zooms out to reveal Northern battleships forming a naval blockage.,4,2,16
Korra,If only we had a plane to get me close to those ships. I could waterbend them out of the way.,4,2,16
Varrick,"A plane? Well, why didn't you say so?",4,2,16
,"Varrick presses a button, causing a biplane to emerge from a hatch. The wings unfold.",4,2,16
Mako,"Um, why do you have a plane on your boat?",4,2,16
Varrick,"In case the boat sinks, of course.",4,2,16
Asami,But there's no runway. How are we supposed to take off?,4,2,16
Varrick,"Zhu Li! Take a note: ""Build runway"".",4,2,16
Zhu Li,"Yes, sir.",4,2,16
Korra,I have an idea.,4,2,16

Korra,Where are the prisoners?,4,2,16
,"The crew member looks off in fear. Cut to the side of the battleship, where Tonraq and the rebels are escaping.",4,2,16

Jinora,Sure!,4,2,16
Meelo,Yeah! [Siblings exit.],4,2,16

Kya,And we're sorry for dumping our frustrations with Dad out on you.,4,2,16
Bumi,"Yeah, you didn't deserve that.",4,2,16

Tonraq,The best way for you to help is by getting the president of the United Republic on our side. The South can give Unalaq a good fight for a while. But we'll need the United Forces in order to win this war.,4,2,16

Korra,For what? I started a civil war.,4,2,16
Bolin,Exactly! Now Eska and I are officially broken up.,4,2,16
Varrick,"Oh, looks like we have company! And not the fun kind!",4,2,16
,"Cut to the horizon, where there is a gigantic wave.",4,2,16
Mako,What is that?,4,2,16
,"Bolin takes the telescope from Varrick to take a better look. He gasps before rubbing his eyes for a second look. Cuts to Bolin's view, where he sees an enraged Eska with smudged make-up rushing toward them with waterbending.",4,2,16
Bolin,That would be my darling Eska. Quick question: is this thing fast enough to get away from my crazy waterbending ex-girlfriend?,4,2,16
Varrick,Why do you think I built this boat?,4,2,16
,Cut to the yacht speeding away into the horizon.,4,2,16
,Fade to credits.,4,2,16
,"Cut to an aerial shot of the Republic City harbor, where Varrick's yacht is docked. Cut to Chief Lin Beifong, who oversees Water Tribe criminals being loaded into trucks before noticing Team Avatar departing the yacht. Lin walks up to Korra and Mako.",5,2,17
Lin,"Welcome home, Avatar. [Sarcastically.] Thanks for starting a war.",5,2,17
Korra,"[Defensively.] I didn't start a war. Well, I did, but it's more complicated than you're making it seem.",5,2,17
Lin,"Mako, I want you back on the beat. There's going to be a Southern Water Tribe peace march tonight. I need you there to make sure things don't get out of hand.",5,2,17
Mako,I'm all yours.,5,2,17
Korra,I'll go too. The people of the South need to see that the Avatar is on their side in the fight against the Northern invaders.,5,2,17
Lin,"[Sarcastically.] Great, that should calm them down. [Walks away.]",5,2,17
Mako,Maybe you should sit this out.,5,2,17
Korra,What?,5,2,17
Mako,I just think having you there blatantly supporting one side will only make things worse. You could at least try to seem neutral.,5,2,17
Korra,I'm not neutral! The North invaded my home. The only reason I'm here is to get the Republic to send troops to help the South.,5,2,17
Varrick,Zhu Li's already scheduled a meeting for us with President Raiko tomorrow. We'll get them on board.,5,2,17
Mako,"Whatever, I gotta go to work. [Walks away.]",5,2,17
Asami,I better go check on my factory. [Walks away.],5,2,17
Korra,I'm going to find out about this peace march. [Walks away.],5,2,17
Varrick,And I am dying for a pedicure. [Walks away with Zhu Li.],5,2,17
Bolin,"So, um, what should I be doing?",5,2,17
Mako,"I don't know, Bolin. Figure something out.",5,2,17
Varrick,"[Turns around and approaches Bolin.] Say, kid, have you ever seen Republic City at night? [Pabu hides in Bolin's shirt.]",5,2,17
Bolin,"Sure, I live here.",5,2,17
Varrick,Have you really seen it?,5,2,17
Bolin,Y- no?,5,2,17
Varrick,[Chuckles.] That's what I thought. Come on.,5,2,17
,Cut to the Southern Water Tribe war room.,5,2,17
General,[Pointing to map.] Tonraq and the rebels are holed up here in the hills outside of town.,5,2,17
Unalaq,Leave them. My brother's no threat to us up there. Increase security around the spirit portal. Keeping it safe is our number one priority.,5,2,17
General,"Yes, sir!",5,2,17
,"The general leaves the war room. He opens the door to find Desna and a deranged Eska in a bridal gown and smudged make-up. He leaves the room in fear, keeping a distance from Eska. The twins approach their father.",5,2,17
Unalaq,I need you two to go after the Avatar. She's the only one who can open the Northern spirit portal.,5,2,17
Desna,"But Father, you told Korra-",5,2,17
Unalaq,I told Korra what I thought she needed to hear.,5,2,17
Eska,I'll find her. [Angrily.] She stole my husband.,5,2,17
Unalaq,I need her alive.,5,2,17
Eska,[Sighs.] Fine.,5,2,17
,"Cut to the Southern Air Temple, where Meelo is training Poki, while Tenzin is reading a scroll.",5,2,17
Meelo,"Watch me, Poki. [Kneeling.] You lie down and roll over. [Rolls as a demonstration.] Roll. Over.",5,2,17
Tenzin,"No, no, you can't just demonstrate it. That never works.",5,2,17
Meelo,[Poki curls up and falls asleep.] Good! [Gives Poki a treat.],5,2,17
Tenzin,"[Sighs.] Ugh, classic over-rewarding.",5,2,17
,"Meelo is using a treat to play with Poki, while a noise is heard from a distance. Poki follows the noise and flies off.",5,2,17
Meelo,"Poki, where are you going?",5,2,17
Tenzin,"Command respect. [Walks to Meelo, while Poki is perched on a tree.] Having some trouble, son?",5,2,17
Meelo,Poki isn't very good at learning.,5,2,17
Tenzin,"Believe me, I know the feeling. Maybe I can help. How would you like your old dad to teach you how to be a master trainer?",5,2,17
Meelo,[Smiles widely.] Yeah!,5,2,17
,"Cut to the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center, with a statue of Sokka overlooking the compound. A huge number of people have congregated, while police riot vehicles have been employed to control the crowd. Cut to Chief Lin Beifong overlooking the event with her officers. Cut to Southerners being led by Korra riding atop Naga. Some of them are holding lit candles on paper lotuses, while others are holding signs.",5,2,17
Reporter,"Tensions are running up high outside of the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center. The Avatar is leading a group of Southerners in a peaceful protest against Chief Unalaq, but the Northerners have come out in droves in support of their leader.",5,2,17
Northern protesters,[Jeering.] Boo! Get out of here! Boo! Get a real job! Get out of here!,5,2,17
,"Cut to the back of the cultural center, where Mako is on patrol. Two suspicious characters are stealthily escaping, but one steps on a can, alerting Mako.",5,2,17
Mako,Hey! Stop! Republic City Police!,5,2,17
,"A man presses a remote controller before running. Mako pursues them but is stopped by an explosion. He controls the spread of the fire with firebending. Cut to the front of the center, which explodes, leaving everyone looking on in fear and shock. Cut to the back of the center, where Mako is fighting the men. He throws multiple fire blasts and kicks, but one of them retaliates with firebending. He is subsequently knocked off and drops the remote, but makes his way into the getaway Satomobile. Mako attacks the Satomobile with a fire blast, but they manage to escape. He walks up to the remote and picks it up. Cut to the front of the center, where Korra is extinguishing the fire using water from the fountain.",5,2,17
Korra,[Mako approaches.] The Northern Water Tribe is out of control!,5,2,17
Mako,I saw a firebender running away from the blast. The North might not be responsible for this.,5,2,17
Korra,"Of course, they're responsible. Who else would it be? [Runs to an approaching fire truck.]",5,2,17
,"Cut to the Pro-bending Arena, where there is a parked limousine. Bolin, Varrick, and Zhu Li are standing outside the limo, while photographers are continually taking pictures. Bolin is in surprise, while Varrick is waving at the audience.",5,2,17
Bolin,"Wow. Usually, when I see flashing lights like this, it's because I got hit in the head with a rock.",5,2,17
Varrick,Being famous is like getting hit with a rock all the time.,5,2,17
,"Cut to the interior of the arena, where Varrick and Bolin take their seats in a VIP booth.",5,2,17
Spectator,Look! It's Bolin!,5,2,17
,"The crowd chants out Bolin's name, which Bolin responds to by waving and flexing his muscles.",5,2,17
Shiro Shinobi,"Folks, that cheer you're hearing is for local favorite, Bolin, of the Fire Ferrets. Let's see if we can get a quick interview. Bolin! [Gestures for Bolin.] Bolin, the Fire Ferrets are out for the season. How have you been spending your time lately?",5,2,17
Bolin,"Well, I took a trip South for the Glacier Spirits Festival, was briefly engaged to a princess, then went through kind of a tough breakup there, was accidentally involved in a civil war ... [Brief pause, someone in the crowd coughs.] But there's nowhere I'd rather be than pro-bending night in Republic City! Am I right, people? Republic City! [Crowd cheers.]",5,2,17
Shiro Shinobi,Do you miss being in the ring?,5,2,17
Bolin,"Well, I definitely don't miss getting hit with things all the time, and the humiliating losing. I mean, that gets pretty old. You know, sometimes I actually cry myself to sleep ... [Crowd falls silent; someone coughs.] I guess what I miss the most are these fans! They're the greatest fans in the world! Give it up for the fans! [Crowd cheers.]",5,2,17
,"Bolin leaves the booth, where Varrick is waiting at the entrance.",5,2,17
Varrick,"Look how these people love you, kid! They're eating that cornball spiel right out of your hand.",5,2,17
Bolin,"The trick is, whenever I get confused, I just say ""Republic City"" or ""fans"", and then everyone cheers.",5,2,17
Varrick,I think I just figured out your true calling.,5,2,17
,Cut to City Hall.,5,2,17
Korra,I hope President Raiko listens to us.,5,2,17
Varrick,Don't worry. I was a big contributor to his election campaign. Him and the other guy. Gotta hedge your bets.,5,2,17
,Cut to the office interior.,5,2,17
Korra,"Hello, Mr. President. [Shakes hands with Raiko.] Sir, the Southern Water Tribe-",5,2,17
Raiko,"Just a second. Keep smiling. [Korra looks on at the camera, but Varrick pokes her, causing her to flinch awkwardly before the photo is taken.]",5,2,17
Raiko,"Now, how can I help the Avatar and my most generous supporter?",5,2,17
Korra,Unalaq's troops have invaded the South. We need you to send the United Forces to help.,5,2,17
Raiko,I'm very concerned by what's happening down there. But I don't think it's the Republic's place to interfere with internal Water Tribe matters.,5,2,17
Korra,Unalaq isn't even the rightful ruler of the Water Tribe. He lied his way onto the Northern throne.,5,2,17
Varrick,"Mr. President, the Republic is already involved in this conflict. The North attacked our cultural center last night.",5,2,17
Raiko,"Believe me, we are doing everything we can to bring the people responsible to justice.",5,2,17
Korra,"""The people responsible""? Who else would it be but the Northerners?",5,2,17
Raiko,"Now, I know that when you're young, it's hard to keep perspective-",5,2,17
Korra,"[Accusingly.] You're the one who's lost perspective. I'm trying to save my tribe, and you're taking pictures.",5,2,17
Raiko,"Sending troops is not something I can do at this time. But I promise I will work with Unalaq and the South for a diplomatic solution. Now, I'm sorry, but my mind is made up. This meeting is over.",5,2,17
Korra,"My family is going to be wiped out, and it'll be on your head for doing nothing about it. [Walks away with Varrick.]",5,2,17
,Raiko has a guilty look in his eyes while the camera focuses on his face. Cut to Mako's residence.,5,2,17
Korra,[Agitated.] I can't believe the President is doing nothing! H-He doesn't even care!,5,2,17
Mako,"I'm sure he cares, but he can't just tell his people to go fight a battle at the South Pole that has nothing to do with them.",5,2,17
Korra,[Exasperated.] How could you take his side?,5,2,17
Mako,What's with you and sides? Why do you always think I'm working against you?,5,2,17
Korra,"Well, you're not helping me! I'm trying to get troops to the South. What are you doing?",5,2,17
Mako,I'm doing my job.,5,2,17
Korra,"[Sarcastically with anger.] Well, excuse me, officer. Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets. I'm just trying to save the world.",5,2,17
Mako,"Well, you wouldn't have to if you didn't keep messing it up!",5,2,17
Korra,I can't talk to you when you're like this. [Storms off and slams a door.],5,2,17
Mako,[Snaps angrily.] You're the one who's like this!,5,2,17
,"Cut to the harbor, where Asami is walking, but gets cut off by Korra.",5,2,17
Asami,Huh? [Annoyed.] Hey! In a hurry?,5,2,17
Korra,"Sorry, I have to talk to Varrick.",5,2,17
Asami,"Yeah, me too.",5,2,17
,"Korra and Asami enter Varrick's yacht. There are stray arrows everywhere. An arrow nearly hits Asami, but Korra pulls her out of the way. Both girls turn to see a blindfolded Varrick holding a bow, while Bolin and Zhu Li stand next to him.",5,2,17
Varrick,"[Removes blindfold.] Oh, hello! [To Bolin.] See? I told you I could do it.",5,2,17
Bolin,Sorry I ever doubted you.,5,2,17
Korra,We can't wait for the President to act. We need those troops now.,5,2,17
Asami,And my company is about to go under. I have to find a way to make some sales.,5,2,17
Varrick,"Right, okay. Got it. Idea storm! [To Zhu Li.] Get the supplies! [To Korra and Asami.] You're about to get an inside look at how Varrick Global Industries stays at the forefront of imagination innovation, or ""imagivation""! That's trademarked, pal. [Takes a chili pepper, while Asami and Korra glance at each other with unsure looks.] Brainwork requires increased circulation. [Eats the chili pepper and reddens.] Let's do this! [Hangs himself upside-down.] Okay, here come the ideas. Fast and furious. Pink mint lemon tea. Radio for pets. Uh, hand shoes. Hold on a tic. We don't need the President to go to the South. We just need the troops! Let's go straight to them! If there's one thing I know about troops, it's that they love fighting.",5,2,17
Korra,I know General Iroh. He might be willing to help us.,5,2,17
Varrick,A man on the inside. Perfect! [To Asami.] And you need to sell some mecha tanks. I know some people who need them. We'll ship 'em South.,5,2,17
Korra,That's perfect! You'll be making money for your company and you'll be helping to defeat Unalaq.,5,2,17
Varrick,"It's true. If you can't make money during a war, you just flat-out cannot make money.",5,2,17
Asami,"It's dangerous on the seas right now, but I'm willing to try if you are.",5,2,17
Varrick,"It'll be crazy risky, but I love crazy risky! End storm! [Swings himself upright with a spin; to Zhu Li.] Zhu Li, get those other ideas to research and development. I want prototypes by next week. [Zhu Li runs off.]",5,2,17
Korra,I don't understand why it's so hard to get Republic City to support the South.,5,2,17
Varrick,"Don't worry, I'm already working on that. As soon as people see this, they'll be lining up to fight Unalaq. Zhu Li, do the, uh-- the thing.",5,2,17
Bolin,Don't freak out. It's not real.,5,2,17
Varrick,I had a film crew documenting the entire Northern invasion.,5,2,17
,"The screen shows troops amassing at the harbor. It subsequently cuts to troops waterbending, followed by Eska, who notices the camera.",5,2,17
Bolin,"[Covers his face in fear, while Pabu jumps off.] Ahhh! Sorry. I keep doing that.",5,2,17
Varrick,"We're gonna cut this footage together with scenes we shoot of our superstar Bolin here playing a Southern Water Tribe hero [Dramatically.] battling the evil Unalaq. No one will root for the North after they see ""The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South""!",5,2,17
Bolin,"[Flexing his muscles, brightly.] I'm Nuktuk! What do you think?",5,2,17
,"Cut to Mako's residence, where Mako is flipping through a book of criminals' faces.",5,2,17
Bolin,"Oh, man, you should have seen Varrick today. That guy is a genius.",5,2,17
Mako,Uh-huh.,5,2,17
Bolin,"He's gonna help Asami sell her mecha tanks to the South, and he came up with this great idea for Korra to get General Iroh to fight Unalaq without President Raiko ever even knowing.",5,2,17
Mako,What? That's a terrible idea!,5,2,17
Bolin,"And he's gonna put me in the movers as this hero, Nuktuk! [Imitating Varrick.] He's a man of action, but he's got a heart of gold. He was born in the tundra.",5,2,17
Mako,"Look, I'm trying to do something that's actually important here.",5,2,17
Bolin,"Oh. Oh, sorry. Uh, sure. What is it?",5,2,17
Mako,Something doesn't make sense about this bombing. I just don't buy that the Northern Water Tribe was behind it. [Bolin flips the book.] Wait a second! That's him! That's the guy that attacked the center! I gotta go show this to Beifong! [Walks away.],5,2,17
Bolin,Glad I could help. Nuktuk saves the day again!,5,2,17
,Cut to Southern Air Temple.,5,2,17
Tenzin,"All right, Meelo, the first thing you need to do as a trainer is establish dominance. You are in charge. Never forget that. Now call Poki.",5,2,17
Meelo,"[Dominantly.] Poki, come here! [Poki remains in place.] Poki. [Poki jumps forward and crawls over Meelo, tickling him.] Poki, no!",5,2,17
Tenzin,Meelo ... you're rewarding him for bad behavior.,5,2,17
Meelo,But he's tickling me.,5,2,17
,"Cut to the bedroom, where Meelo and Poki are about to sleep.",5,2,17
Tenzin,"You can't let him nap in the bed with you. You are the alpha lemur. He has to sleep on the floor. [Meelo sadly places Poki onto the floor.] I know it's hard, [Poki jumps back to bed.] but it's for the best.",5,2,17
Meelo,"No, Poki, this is my bed. [Puts Poki back to the floor.] You sleep on the floor. [Poki looks at Meelo pitifully, while Meelo looks at his pet sadly.] Being alpha lemur is lonely. [Sleeps.]",5,2,17
Tenzin,I know.,5,2,17
,Cut to the police headquarters.,5,2,17
Raiko,How did this Cultural Center attack happen right under your nose? And why haven't you arrested the Northerners responsible?,5,2,17
Lin,"We're working on it, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"Well, work harder! If you don't get any results soon, I'm going to find someone who can.",5,2,17
Mako,I got a break in the bombing case. I I.D.'d the guy I saw at the scene.,5,2,17
Lu,"That's great, Mako.",5,2,17
Gang,"Yeah, you better run that in to Beifong right now.",5,2,17
Mako,You think?,5,2,17
Lu,Sure. You're gonna be a hero!,5,2,17
,Mako looks confidently at the picture before entering Lin's office. Lu and Gang laugh and make their signature handshake.,5,2,17
Lin,"What makes a rookie beat cop think he can interrupt my meeting with the President? [Lu and Gang laugh, with Lu banging the table.]",5,2,17
Mako,"I'm sorry, I just-- um, I found something out about the bombing. [Lu styles his hair like Mako and imitates his actions, while Gang laughs.]",5,2,17
Lin,"Well, give it to Lu and Gang, you moron. [Snaps.] Now get out! [Lu puts his hair back, while Mako leaves Lin's office.]",5,2,17
Lu,Sorry. Was she busy?,5,2,17
Mako,This is the guy I saw sneaking out of the building right before the explosions. He's a member of the Agni Kais. Someone must have hired him to make it look like Northerners attacked the Cultural Center. [Gang takes the picture.],5,2,17
Gang,Hmm. [Drops picture into a drawer.],5,2,17
Mako,Did you learn anything about that remote control I found at the scene? That's gotta be the key to finding out who's really responsible.,5,2,17
Lu,"Listen, kid, it was the Northern Water Tribe, okay?",5,2,17
Gang,"Yeah, give it a rest, Super Cop.",5,2,17
,Mako returns to the desk while President Raiko exits Lin's office and walks to Mako's desk.,5,2,17
Raiko,I've heard good things about you. You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.,5,2,17
Mako,"Thank you, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"And you're dating the Avatar, right?",5,2,17
Mako,"Yes, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick. You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything that might compromise the security of Republic City, would you, officer? [Mako glances uneasily.] Let me remind you that you've sworn an oath. You're a man of the law before anything else.",5,2,17
Mako,"Yes, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"Well, keep up the good work. [Walks away.]",5,2,17
Mako,"[Reluctantly after a sigh.] Wait, there's something you should know.",5,2,17
,Cut to the United Forces Harbor.,5,2,17
Korra,"Thank you for seeing me, General Iroh.",5,2,17
Iroh,What can I do?,5,2,17
Korra,"The South needs military support before Unalaq wipes them out completely, but the President is refusing to give the order. So I decided to come to you directly.",5,2,17
Iroh,"I see. Well, suppose I were to take the fleet South on some routine training maneuvers. And let's say we were to accidentally run into a hostile Northern blockade. We'd have no choice but to defend ourselves, wouldn't we?",5,2,17
Korra,I guess you wouldn't. Thank you!,5,2,17
Raiko,[Enters the ship.] Swapping old war stories?,5,2,17
Iroh,[Salutes.] Mr. President.,5,2,17
Raiko,I hope you're not planning to take any military action without an order from your commander-in-chief?,5,2,17
Iroh,"Of course not, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"Good. Because if a single vessel leaves this harbor without my say-so, you'll be court-martialed. Am I clear?",5,2,17
Iroh,"Crystal, sir.",5,2,17
Raiko,"[To Korra.] Your activities here are bordering on insurrection. The Avatar does not command the military of the Republic. Don't go behind my back again. [To Iroh.] As you were, General Iroh. [Leaves the ship.]",5,2,17
Korra,[Angrily.] I hate that guy!,5,2,17
Iroh,[Apologetically.] I'm sorry. My hands are officially tied.,5,2,17
Korra,I understand. Thanks anyway.,5,2,17
Iroh,"[Brightly.] But you should talk to the Fire Lord. My mother and grandfather have always been good friends with the Avatar, and the Southern Water Tribe. I'm sure they'll be willing to help.",5,2,17
Korra,"Thank you, General.",5,2,17
,"Cut to Varrick's yacht, where Bolin is filming in a revealing Water Tribe outfit.",5,2,17
Bolin,Wouldn't I be cold wearing this outfit in the snow?,5,2,17
Varrick,"Ah, Nuktuk is never cold.",5,2,17
Bolin,"[Ginger walks past.] Ohhh. [Flirting.] Hey, Ginger.",5,2,17
Varrick,"[Ginger walks up beside Varrick and flips her hair.] How about that, huh? It's the latest product in my Varri-manageable Hair Line: Varri-dye! We get some shots of her using it before Unalaq kidnaps her, I guarantee we sell a million cases week one.",5,2,17
Korra,"[Riding atop Naga.] Bolin, I need you to watch Naga while I'm gone.",5,2,17
Bolin,Where are you going?,5,2,17
Korra,The Fire Nation. I'm going to try to get them to help the South. [To Varrick.] I need a boat.,5,2,17
Varrick,What happened with General Iroh?,5,2,17
Korra,"He was going to help, but then President Raiko showed up. Someone must have tipped him off, but I can't figure it out. No one knew about it except for us and Asami.",5,2,17
Bolin,And Mako.,5,2,17
Korra,Mako? [Glares sourly at Bolin.],5,2,17
Bolin,What? [Confidently.] There's no way Mako would have told. [Korra storms off.] Right?,5,2,17
,Cut to the Southern Air Temple.,5,2,17
Meelo,"[Dominantly.] Poki, sit! [Poki sits.] Roll over. [Poki rolls.] Good boy. [Throws a treat to Poki.]",5,2,17
Tenzin,"Well done, Meelo! I knew you could learn to train Poki.",5,2,17
Meelo,Not just Poki. I trained all the lemurs. Watch!,5,2,17
,"Meelo blows a whistle, causing Poki to run away and fly. It is accompanied by many more lemurs. Meelo's entire family look on in awe. Meelo blows his whistle, commanding the lemurs to fly toward the direction in which he is pointing. On a final blow and a point to the ground, all the lemurs land on the floor, with Poki at the center.",5,2,17
Tenzin,"[Laments to himself.] I've created a monster. [To Meelo.] Uh, maybe we should forget about all this training discipline for now. Why don't you and Poki just have fun and play?",5,2,17
Meelo,"Thanks, dad, training makes me tired. Come on, Poki.",5,2,17
,"Meelo runs back to his room with Poki. With a blow of his whistle, all the remaining lemurs leave the scene. Cut to the police office, where Korra kicks the door open.",5,2,17
Korra,[Agitatedly.] You ratted me out to the President?,5,2,17
Mako,"[Calmly.] Korra, let me explain.",5,2,17
Korra,Explain why my boyfriend stabbed me in the back?,5,2,17
Mako,"Look, the President of the Republic asked me a direct question. What was I supposed to do?",5,2,17
Korra,"[Angrily and accusingly.] You betrayed me, and my family! [Kicks Mako's desk aside with airbending.]",5,2,17
Mako,"[Snaps.] Enough! Look, I have a job to do! I can't constantly be worrying about keeping you from making another huge mistake!",5,2,17
Korra,"[Angrily.] Well, I have a job to do too, only it seems like you're always standing in the way of me getting it done!",5,2,17
Mako,"Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship! [Both look at each other in silence.]",5,2,17
Korra,"[Sadly.] So, what? Are you breaking up with me?",5,2,17
Mako,[Sadly.] Yeah. I guess I am.,5,2,17
,A tearful Korra runs out of the office. Lin exits her office in shock.,5,2,17
Lin,What the flameo happened here?!,5,2,17
Mako,[Sadly.] I broke up with the Avatar.,5,2,17
Lin,[Smirking.] You got off easy. You shoulda seen Air Temple Island after Tenzin broke up with me!,5,2,17
,"Cut to the Mo Ce Sea, where Korra is driving a speedboat with a tear on her face. She wipes it off but is interrupted by a bump. She looks back and notices her cousins are attacking her with waterbending.",5,2,17
Eska,[Enraged.] You ruined my wedding!,5,2,17
,"Eska throws a stream at Korra, but she manages to dodge it. She destroys her cousins' jet skis, but they glide on the water and soon catch up with her.",5,2,17
Eska,[Enraged.] No one steals my Bolin!,5,2,17
,"Eska destroys Korra's speedboat, throwing her overboard. Underwater, Korra emerges from a waterspout and attacks her cousins with firebending, while avoiding their waterbending attacks. Eska manages to knock Korra off, but Korra regains her balance with an airspout before jumping on another waterspout. She quickly bends a water dome, trapping her cousins. Cut to Eska and Desna shielding themselves from the water before they notice a green glow underwater. Both look at each other and retreat. Korra notices her cousins retreating and starts descending. A giant dark spirit emerges and Korra dodges its attacks but is knocked off her waterspout. Underwater, Korra enters the Avatar State and re-emerges. She attempts to purify the spirit, causing it to glow golden, except for the head. The spirit prepares to head underwater, but re-emerges at the last minute and proceeds to devour Korra. Korra futilely firebends at the spirit before being swallowed and dragged into the water below. Cut to Eska and Desna, who have witnessed the entire incident. They leave the scene.",5,2,17
,Fade to credits.,5,2,17
,"Scene opens to a lone ship. The captain notices three flashing red lights being thrown onto the deck before exploding. A similar device is thrown to the wall behind the captain, but he manages to jump off onto the deck before the device explodes.",6,2,18
Captain,We're under attack!,6,2,18
,"Four waterbenders ambush the ship, swamping it with water. The scene changes to crew members on an escape raft while looking at the destroyed ship.",6,2,18
Captain,Varrick is not gonna be happy about this.,6,2,18
,"Cut the Southern Spirit Portal, which has been fortified with a surrounding wall and watchtowers. Cut to Eska and Desna standing outside the portal.",6,2,18
Eska,Where is he?,6,2,18
Desna,Father said he would meet us at this location. He'll be here. [Unalaq emerges from the spirit portal.] Were you just in the Spirit World?,6,2,18
Unalaq,Never mind that. Where is the Avatar?,6,2,18
Eska,She was within our grasp until a dark spirit attacked her.,6,2,18
Desna,They're out of control.,6,2,18
Unalaq,[Angry.] You didn't get her?,6,2,18
Eska,The Avatar is dead.,6,2,18
,"Unalaq looks at his children with disappointment. Cut to the cinema, where The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South is being screened. Nuktuk walks ahead and hides behind a mound when he sees an ominous castle.",6,2,18
Nuktuk,"We finally made it. Now, we must stop the evil Unalaq! [Crowd cheers.]",6,2,18
Evil Unalaq,"The Southern Water Tribe is mine. Next, I will conquer the world with my waterbending doomsday device!",6,2,18
,"The crowd jeers while throwing popcorn at the screen. Cut to the audience, who are mostly children.",6,2,18
Nuktuk,"Don't worry, Juji and Roh-Tan, I will end the evil Unalaq's reign of terror. For I am Nuktuk, hero of the South! [Crowd cheers.]",6,2,18
Juji,"Nuktuk, you're not just the hero of the South, you're our best friend.",6,2,18
Roh-Tan,Nuktuk-ity!,6,2,18
Nuktuk,[Hugs Roh-Tan.] You two are the best snow raccoon and arctic panda a guy could ask for.,6,2,18
Crowd,Aww!,6,2,18
Voice narrator,"[Music starts; Ginger is hugging Nuktuk while atop Roh-Tan. Narrator starts to sing.] Who's gonna fight for friends and freedom? Nuktuk. [Nuktuk makes dancing movement and a water jet hits Northern soldiers, causing one to fall.] He's the biggest, baddest, bendingest man I know. [Nuktuk jumps up and taps his companions' paws.] Who protects the icy tundra? Nuktuk. [Nuktuk makes dancing movements once more and water falls over another soldier.] Battling Northies out there in the snow. [Evil Unalaq looks ahead, while Nuktuk punches him off balances.] When Unalaq starts trouble, he'll punch him in the mouth. [Nuktuk grins standing next to Roh-Tan, while Juji emerges from a snow mound.] He's Nuktuk, the hero of the South. [Crowd cheers.]",6,2,18
Varrick,"[Pans to a booth, where Varrick, Bolin and Ginger are seated.] Bolin, look up there. What do you see?",6,2,18
Bolin,[Confused.] I- is this a trick question?,6,2,18
Varrick,"I'll tell you what I see: a star being born. You're a star. People love stars. Stars tell them what to think and how to act. Bolin, have you ever tried to force a monkey marmot to ride a bicycle?",6,2,18
Bolin,Uh ... not that I can recall.,6,2,18
Varrick,Of course you haven't. You can't force monkey marmots to do anything. They've got to want to do it themselves!,6,2,18
Bolin,Right ...,6,2,18
Varrick,"With these movers, we'll have the support of the people, and before long, they'll persuade the President to lend his troops to the war effort.",6,2,18
,"On screen, a bound Ginger is escorted to Evil Unalaq's throne.",6,2,18
Evil Unalaq,[Laughs sinisterly.] My evil plan is working. I've captured Nuktuk's beautiful girlfriend.,6,2,18
Nuktuk,"[Enters the throne room.] Not so fast, Evil Unalaq! Oh, I will save my true love and the South! [Defeats the guards with waterbending.] And now, your time is up.",6,2,18
,"Evil Unalaq gestures for his guards to attack Nuktuk. Nuktuk retreats such that only shadows of the fight can be seen. He breaks off a spear of one of the guards before throwing him up, and throws the other guard up with waterbending. Two more guards approach and throw a net, capturing him.",6,2,18
Evil Unalaq,"It's no use fighting, Nuktuk. My anti-energy net makes bending impossible. [Laughs sinisterly.]",6,2,18
Nuktuk,[Dramatically.] No! Please. Power ... weakening.,6,2,18
Ron-Tah,Nuk-terrible.,6,2,18
Voice narrator,Will this be the end of Nuktuk? Can he escape from Unalaq's trap and save the beautiful Ginger? Find out next week on The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South.,6,2,18
Bolin,[Cut back to the booth.] Wow. We got some major chemistry on-screen. Am I right?,6,2,18
Ginger,Yeah. On-screen. [Scoffs and leaves.],6,2,18
Bolin,"What's wrong? Are you mad because I left you in the clutches of the evil Unalaq? I'm gonna save you in the next episode. [Desperate.] Ginger, let's work through this.",6,2,18
Zhu Li,"Varrick, another one of your ships has been captured.",6,2,18
Varrick,"[Angrily.] Darn it, Zhu Li, haven't I told you I hate getting bad news without first getting good news?",6,2,18
Zhu Li,"[Glances.] Oh, well, the good news is it looks like your first mover has gotten a great reception.",6,2,18
Varrick,That's old news! Let's go. [Exits.],6,2,18
,Cut to the police headquarters. Mako looks sadly at a picture of him and Korra. Asami enters.,6,2,18
Asami,Is it true?,6,2,18
Mako,[Put back the photo.] I'm so sorry. Your entire shipment was stolen.,6,2,18
Asami,"[Worried.] Without that sale, I don't know how much longer I can keep my company going. What am I gonna do?",6,2,18
Mako,Don't worry. I'm gonna find whoever's responsible. Chief Beifong is about to question the captain of the ship. [Pushes the button of the intercom.],6,2,18
Lin,"I know it's been a long day, but walk me through what happened.",6,2,18
Captain,We were ambushed about thirty klicks outside the harbor. We never heard them coming.,6,2,18
Lin,This is the third attack this week at about the same location.,6,2,18
Lu,"Yep, and smack-dab in Republic City's jurisdiction, which means another problem for us. [Sighs and starts stroking his mustache.] All this stress is gonna turn old black beauty gray.",6,2,18
Gang,It's gotta be Northern Water Tribe. They're trying to stop supply lines to the South.,6,2,18
Lin,I agree. Is there anything else about the attack you remember? Anything unusual?,6,2,18
Captain,There is one thing. The bombs exploded in a way I've never seen before. They didn't have fuses. [Cut back to Mako and Asami.] It was like they were being detonated remotely.,6,2,18
Mako,Like the bombs at the cultural center. [Walks away.],6,2,18
Asami,"Wait, where are you going?",6,2,18
Mako,I gotta grab some evidence. [Exits the room while Varrick enters.],6,2,18
Varrick,"Asami, I heard the news. I can't believe they took my fifth favorite ship in the Varrick Industries fleet! Named her after my mom. Rest in piece, Rocky Bottom.",6,2,18
Asami,"Without the money from that shipment, Future Industries is almost broke.",6,2,18
Mako,"Chief, I think there's a link between this attack and the attack at the cultural center.",6,2,18
Lin,[Aggressively.] What do you think you're doing?,6,2,18
Mako,Solving this case. Did any of the people who attacked you have one of these in their hand? I think it's a remote detonator.,6,2,18
Captain,It was too dark to see anything.,6,2,18
Lin,[Sharply.] Mako!,6,2,18
Mako,"Chief, I don't think the people who attacked were Northern Water Tribe.",6,2,18
Gang,Of course they were Northern Water Tribe. They were waterbending.,6,2,18
Mako,Was this one of the guys who attacked?,6,2,18
Captain,"No, I don't recognize him.",6,2,18
Gang,"Oh, that's embarrassing.",6,2,18
Lu,"[Chuckles.] Nice try, Rookie.",6,2,18
Lin,"Mako, leave. [Threateningly.] Now.",6,2,18
Varrick,"[Enters the room with Asami.] Great work, everybody. Another open and shut case for the dynamic mustachioed duo!",6,2,18
Asami,"Wait, I think Mako might be onto something.",6,2,18
Mako,"Chief, I know it's a long shot, but I have an idea how we can catch these guys.",6,2,18
Lu,"[Sarcastically.] Yeah, let's all listen to the rookie.",6,2,18
Asami,He's doing a better job than you!,6,2,18
Varrick,Whooooo's hungry?,6,2,18
Lin,"[Snaps.] Enough! I don't want to hear your lame-brained rookie ideas. You're a beat cop, not a detective. Now hit the street and do your job! [Lu and Gang laugh, while Lu styles his hair like Mako.]",6,2,18
,Cut to the outside of the headquarters.,6,2,18
Mako,Lu and Gang are idiots. I hate them and their stupid mustaches.,6,2,18
Asami,Forget them. What's this idea of yours?,6,2,18
Mako,"A sting operation. I was thinking we'd set up a bait ship, take it out into the open ocean, and capture whoever attacks it.",6,2,18
Asami,Let's do it.,6,2,18
Mako,"It's not that easy. For the plan to work, we need the police, and Beifong already said no.",6,2,18
Asami,"We can make it work, just the two of us.",6,2,18
Mako,"I don't know. I don't want to go behind Beifong's back. If she finds out, I could get kicked off the force.",6,2,18
Asami,"Mako, I need your help. My Mom is gone. My Dad is in jail. Future Industries is all I have left of my family.",6,2,18
Mako,"I want to help you, but this is more than a two-person job. First of all, we'd need a ship.",6,2,18
,Both Mako and Asami turn to find Varrick beside them and they recoil in shock.,6,2,18
Varrick,You need a ship? I got a ship. I want in on whatever you're talking about. I love being in on plans.,6,2,18
Asami,"The less you know, the better.",6,2,18
Varrick,Perfect! I love not knowing things.,6,2,18
Mako,"All right, I'm in. Let's get these guys.",6,2,18
,"Cut to the harbor outside Future Industries. An empty cargo is closed, while two mecha tanks lift the cargo on board. Asami and Mako look on from the warehouse, which is filled with mecha tanks and biplanes.",6,2,18
Asami,The ship's all loaded with the dummy crates. Let's get this sting operation going.,6,2,18
Mako,Not yet. We need some extra manpower.,6,2,18
Asami,What about Korra? [Mako looks on uneasily.] No better muscle than the Avatar.,6,2,18
Mako,"[Uneasy.] Right, uh ... Korra. Yeah, actually, she's um ... she's out of town right now.",6,2,18
Asami,Everything okay with you two?,6,2,18
Mako,"Yeah, yeah. Forget about Korra. I'll go talk to Bolin. [Runs off.]",6,2,18
,"Cut to Mako's apartment. Mako enters, surprised at the new decorations.",6,2,18
Bolin,"[Soaking in a hot tub.] Hey, Mako, what do you think? I did a little redecorating. It turns out that one of the perks of being a star, you get lots of cash.",6,2,18
Mako,[Looks at statue.] Is this a marble statue of you?,6,2,18
Bolin,It's also [Points to head.] a hat rack.,6,2,18
Mako,[Irritated.] We don't even have hats.,6,2,18
Bolin,"That's because we never had a hat rack. And now we do. Mako, you seem stressed. I think you need to take a little dipity dip. [Taps surface of the bath.]",6,2,18
Mako,"I don't have time to take a dipity dip, okay? I'm trying to catch whoever's been attacking the shipments, and I need your help.",6,2,18
Bolin,You need my help? [Groans pensively.] I don't know. I'm kinda busy.,6,2,18
Mako,You're sitting in a hot tub.,6,2,18
Bolin,"I'm maintaining my instrument. As an actor, my body is my instrument.",6,2,18
Mako,[Annoyed.] Are you gonna help or not?,6,2,18
Bolin,"You know, I recall a time when I needed your help, and you basically told me to get a life.",6,2,18
Mako,So that's a no. What am I supposed to do now?,6,2,18
Bolin,"[Mimics his brother.] I don't know, Mako. [Darts to his brother.] Figure it out. Remember? That's what you said to me. Hurts, doesn't it? [Mako groans in annoyance and turns. As he passes the fire heating the tub, he bends in it, causing the water to explode into hot steam. Bolin screams in pain.] Ow! My instrument!",6,2,18
,Cut to outside the Triple Threat Triad headquarters.,6,2,18
Asami,Are you sure this is a good idea?,6,2,18
Mako,"No, but it's our last resort. [Knocks at the door.]",6,2,18
Triple Threat doorman,"[Slides open faceplate.] Hey, Mako. Whatever you think we did, we didn't do it.",6,2,18
Mako,"I'm not here on police business. I'm running an off-the-books operation, and I thought the Triple Threats might want a piece of the action.",6,2,18
Triple Threat doorman,How big a piece?,6,2,18
,"Mako and Asami are now inside the headquarters, seated opposite Viper.",6,2,18
Viper,"So Mr. Law and Order needs our help, huh? What's in it for the Triple Threats?",6,2,18
Mako,I am personal friends with that Avatar. I might be able to convince her to give Shady Shin his bending back.,6,2,18
Shady Shin,"Sounds good to me, boss. [Viper glares at him.]",6,2,18
Viper,What about the rest of us?,6,2,18
Asami,"I've got vehicles, all brand-new and top of the line. They can be yours if you help.",6,2,18
Viper,[Smirks.] I think we got ourselves a deal.,6,2,18
,Cut to the bait ship in the open sea.,6,2,18
Mako,"This is right around the area where the attacks happened. So keep your eyes peeled, and stay quiet.",6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"I agree. Keep quiet. Mouth zipped, don't say a word. That's the best thing to do when you're trying to ambush somebody, which is what we're doing here, and it's basically what I'm always doing. I mean, I am a gangster, after all, and -",6,2,18
Mako,"Two Toed Ping, please.",6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"Oh, right. So, what's it like dating the Avatar. [Mako sighs in annoyance, turning his head.] Come on, Mako, I gotta know.",6,2,18
Mako,"Ping, stay focused!",6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"What? What are you so weird about it? If I was dating the Avatar, I'd tell you all about it.",6,2,18
Mako,[Curtly.] There's nothing to know. [Softer.] I broke up with her.,6,2,18
Asami,[Surprised.] You broke up? When? Why didn't you tell me?,6,2,18
Mako,I don't know.,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"[Starts laughing.] Yeah, right. You broke up with the Avatar. Like that happened. Hey, Shady Shin, Viper. Mako says he broke up with the Avatar.",6,2,18
Shady Shin,Sure he did.,6,2,18
Viper,"Yeah, I did too. [The Triple Threats burst out laughing.]",6,2,18
Mako,"All right, would you guys knock it off and do your job?",6,2,18
,Cut to the film set of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South. Nuktuk is about to save a bound Ginger while a drill is above them.,6,2,18
Assistant director,And action!,6,2,18
Ginger,[Drill begins descending.] Forget about me. You must capture the evil Unalaq before he gets away.,6,2,18
Nuktuk,No! I'll never leave you.,6,2,18
,"Bolin kisses Ginger, much to her surprise and annoyance.",6,2,18
Varrick,Cut! [Looks at script.] There's no kiss in the script.,6,2,18
Bolin,"[Drill is returned to original position.] Sorry, I just kinda lost myself in the moment. [Dreamily.] It just felts so right.",6,2,18
Ginger,"[Sits up, while making a disgusted face.] Urch.",6,2,18
Varrick,"It did, huh? Your girlfriend's about to die, and instead of untying her, you kiss her. Wait a minute! Maybe that will work. Yes! It's genius! Everybody take five. Except for you, Zhu Li. Grab the tweezers. I've got some neck-hair issues to resolve.",6,2,18
Bolin,So ... that kiss. I liked it. And it seemed like you liked it too.,6,2,18
Ginger,Uch. You're confusing Ginger the actress with Ginger the character.,6,2,18
Bolin,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm totally getting, like, a weird vibe from you right now. It's like, a minute ago, when we were shooting, you were into me, but now you're not.",6,2,18
Ginger,"That's because Ginger loves Nuktuk, not Bolin. [Walks off in annoyance.]",6,2,18
Bolin,But Nuktuk is Bolin. I'm a hero. [Sighs.],6,2,18
,Cut back to the bait ship. Where Ping is talking to Mako and Asami.,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,[Shows his twelve toes.] And that's why they call me [Shakes his extra toes.] Two Toed Ping.,6,2,18
Asami,Because you have two extra toes.,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,That's right. And there was already a Twelve Toed Ping on the south side.,6,2,18
Mako,"Wait, guys. Do you hear that?",6,2,18
Asami,I didn't hear anything.,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,No.,6,2,18
Mako,[Frustrated.] Ah! What's taking so long?,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"You just gotta relax, like me. Maybe try taking your shoes off.",6,2,18
Mako,I'm gonna check it out.,6,2,18
Shady Shin,[Voice-over while Mako approaches.] So how long do we have to stay out here?,6,2,18
Viper,"[Voice-over.] I told you, it's gonna be a few hours. What, do you have a hot date?",6,2,18
,Mako hides under the stairs and looks up. Cut to his point of view.,6,2,18
Shady Shin,"Actually, I do. And I wanna look my best. I gotta shower and shave. I have a whole routine, okay?",6,2,18
Viper,"Well, your date's gonna have to wait.",6,2,18
Shady Shin,She's not gonna be happy about that.,6,2,18
Viper,"Too bad. We were paid to keep Mako and that dame [Cut to Mako overhearing them from his hiding place under a staircase. Voice-over.] distracted for a few hours, so that's what we're gonna do. [Mako's eyes widen.]",6,2,18
Shady Shin,[Voice-over.] See? This is why I never get dates.,6,2,18
,"Mako exits the scene. Cut back to Asami watching Two Toed Ping stroking his toe, when Mako gestures her. Asami walks up to Mako.",6,2,18
Mako,I just overheard Shady Shin and Viper. We've been double-crossed. We have to get off this ship.,6,2,18
,"They run off, only to be cornered by Viper.",6,2,18
Viper,Where do you think you're going?,6,2,18
,Mako knocks the gangsters off with firebending before running off. Both board a speedboat.,6,2,18
Viper,Get'm!,6,2,18
,"Mako burns off the ropes, causing him and Asami to plunge to the sea. The gangsters pursue them with two speedboats. Mako attacks the speedboats with firebending, but misses. Asami makes a sharp turn, causing Mako to nearly lose his balance. Viper jumps off his speedboat and waterbends ice spikes, but Asami manages to dodge them. He waterbends a geyser, throwing Mako and Asami's speedboat into the air. Both manage to remain in the speedboat as it plunges back to the sea. The chase brought them back to mainland Republic City.",6,2,18
Mako,They're getting closer.,6,2,18
Asami,Not for long. [Drives between two ships.],6,2,18
Mako,"Watch out! We're not gonna make it. [Asami makes a swift turn. One of the triad's speedboat fails to execute the same turn and capsize.] One down, one to go.",6,2,18
,Viper's speedboat cuts through in front of them. Asami swerves off and the engine stalls.,6,2,18
Asami,We're stalled.,6,2,18
,"Vipers speed boat approaches. Mako attempts to firebend at them, but the speedboat crashes, throwing him back while the speedboat is being pushed back. Viper leaps to Mako's speedboat and throws a water pulse at him, but Mako manages to dodge. He prepares another attack, but is stopped by Mako. Mako does a fire kick, which Viper manages to neutralize. Mako throws another two fire blasts, which Viper manages to dodge one and neutralize another. Mako misses his attack and is pushed back to the passenger seat by Viper's waterbending attack. Asami manages to restart the engine.",6,2,18
Asami,"Mako, hang onto something. [Swerves violently, throwing the gangsters' speedboat off the water.] What was that all about?",6,2,18
Mako,Someone paid the Triple Threats to keep us distracted.,6,2,18
Asami,Distracted? From what? Oh no.,6,2,18
,"Cut to the warehouse of Future Industries. Asami powers up the warehouse, illuminating an empty warehouse.",6,2,18
Mako,Whoever paid the Triple Threats stole everything.,6,2,18
Asami,[Sadly.] I'm ruined. My company ... it's over.,6,2,18
Mako,We should check out your other warehouses. Maybe they didn't have time to hit them all.,6,2,18
Asami,You don't understand. Everything I had was in here.,6,2,18
Mako,We have to search the place for evidence. If we can find a lead ...,6,2,18
Asami,Mako ... it doesn't matter anymore.,6,2,18
Mako,I can figure this out.,6,2,18
Asami,[Defeated.] Just stop. It's over. I give up.,6,2,18
Mako,"Well, I'm not giving up on you.",6,2,18
Asami,"[She looks at Mako teary eyed and kisses him.] Sorry, I-",6,2,18
Mako,Uh ... It's-it's okay. Um ... Anyway ... I gotta run. I'm gonna find out who did this. And I know just who to ask.,6,2,18
,Cut to daytime in the streets where Mako slams Two Toed Ping against a wall.,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"Hey, Mako. Uh, you're not mad about last night, are you?",6,2,18
Mako,[Threateningly.] Who hired you to double-cross us?,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,I don't know.,6,2,18
Mako,"I think you do know. [Firebends a dagger.] And you're gonna tell me, or we're gonna have to change your name to ""No Toed Ping"".",6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"Really, I don't know. You have to believe me. We never met the guy who hired us.",6,2,18
Mako,[Chuckles.] You expect me to believe that?,6,2,18
Two Toed Ping,"[Fearfully.] After you left the hideout, some mook showed up and said his boss would pay us to keep you distracted. We'd never seen him before, and we ain't seen him since. Come on, Mako, you know how these deals work. Please, I would never lie to you with my lucky toes on the line.",6,2,18
Mako,"[Throws Ping off, slamming him to a wall.] Get out of here.",6,2,18
,Ping runs off in fear. Cut to Bolin in his Nuktuk attire eating some popcorn on set. He is approached by Mako.,6,2,18
Mako,"Bolin, have you seen Varrick around? Bolin! [Sigh. Annoyed.] Nuktuk.",6,2,18
Bolin,"Yes? Oh, hello, Mako. Didn't notice you there.",6,2,18
Mako,Where's Varrick? I need to ask him something.,6,2,18
Bolin,"Hmm. Can't say that I've seen him. But I've been kinda busy, you know, rehearsing for my big scene. There's gonna be some crazy [Makes air quotes.] ""pyrotechnics"". That's mover speak for explosions.",6,2,18
Assistant director,We need Nuktuk on set. Running explosion scene.,6,2,18
Bolin,"Or sometimes we just call them explosions. Anyway, wish I could stand around here and chitchat, but you know, I gotta go shoot my big scene.",6,2,18
,Cut to Bolin at the scene.,6,2,18
Assistant director,"Okay, the set is clear. Camera's rolling. And ... action!",6,2,18
Nuktuk,"Ginger, stay down! I'm coming for you.",6,2,18
,"Mako watches his brother film his set. Nuktuk runs off, with explosions trailing behind him. Mako looks at the explosions, with each explosion lighting his eyes. Cut to the pyrotechnics technician who is loading explosives when Mako approaches.",6,2,18
Mako,How did you rig those explosions to go off like that?,6,2,18
Pyrotechnics technician,"Neat, huh? It's a Varrick Industries exclusive. Here, check it out. [Passes Mako a detonator. Mako's eyes widen.] The explosions use a remote detonator.",6,2,18
Mako,Varrick.,6,2,18
,Cut to Future Industries.,6,2,18
Mako,"[Barging.] Asami, I think I know who set us up.",6,2,18
Varrick,"[Turns over with a sly look.] Hello, Mako.",6,2,18
Mako,What are you doing here?,6,2,18
Asami,[Happily.] He just saved my company. [Slowly zooming in close-up of Varrick. Voice-over.] Varrick bought a controlling interest in Future Industries. Isn't that great?,6,2,18
Varrick,"Yep, I like to think I'm always there to stand up for the little guy. Especially if that little guy can help this guy become a bigger guy.",6,2,18
Asami,"[Brightly.] So what were you saying, Mako? You think you know who hired the Triple Threats?",6,2,18
Mako,"Yeah, and I'm real close to proving it. [Cut to a smirking Varrick.] I'll fill you in later. [Exits.]",6,2,18
,Cut to some tropical island in the Fire Nation where Korra is lying washed up on the beach. She awakes to find three Bhanti tribesmen looming over her.,6,2,18
Korra,[Shocked.] Get away from me!,6,2,18
,"She airbends at the sages, though does not have the strength to keep herself upright and sags down to her knees while panting in exhaustion.",6,2,18
Karu,"It's okay, we're here to help you, Avatar Korra.",6,2,18
Korra,"[Confused.] Who's-who's ""Avatar Korra""?",6,2,18
,The tribesmen look at each other in apprehension.,6,2,18
Karu,What happened to you? How did you end up on our island?,6,2,18
Korra,I ... don't know. I can't remember anything.,6,2,18
,Korra sighs and passes out.,6,2,18
,Fades to credits.,6,2,18
Shiro Shinobi,"[Narrating a newsreel.] The Avatar has gone missing. After President Raiko refused Korra's request to aid the South in the war of the Water Tribes, she headed to the Fire Nation, seeking a new ally against Unalaq. But unbeknownst to her friends, a dark spirit attacked Korra and dragged her into the ocean. She has washed up on a desolate island with no memory of who she is.",7,2,19
,"A close-up of Korra's face, eyes closed, slowly zooms out. The head-shot fades to an aerial shot of her entire body and the pool of water she is lying in, while still zooming out, to the point where the underground pool is left and four members of the Bhanti overseeing Korra's recovery come into view.",8,2,20
Karu,[Voice-over.] Should we pull her up?,8,2,20
Shaman,[Far side-shot panning to the right; voice-over.] No. She is connecting with her deepest Avatar memories. [Closer frontal shot.] She must confront her own past if she is to move forward. [Zooming in close-up of Korra's face; voice-over.] We can only hope that she survives her ordeal.,8,2,20
,"The close-up stops at her closed eyes. They twitch, and suddenly open. When they do, the shot moves back to reveal Korra's entire body, surrounded by a purple light, signaling she is still in her dream world. Korra's spirit is looking wide-eyed at something before her.",8,2,20
Raava,"[Voice-over.] The human and spirit realms are headed toward annihilation. [Back-shot of Korra's head; she turns around upon hearing the voice; voice-over.] And it's all your fault. [The camera turns around Korra to view over her shoulder, showing that she is now looking at a scene between Raava and Wan.] This is why humans have no place [Slowly zooming in on the scene.] interfering in the business of spirits.",8,2,20
Wan,"[Cut to a close-up frontal shot.] This world is home to all of us, and what happens here is everyone's business.",8,2,20
Raava,"[Frontal shot; angry.] Thanks to you, this world may cease to exist! I only hope I can track down Vaatu before it's too late.",8,2,20
Wan,[Frontal shot.] Let me help you.,8,2,20
Raava,"[Cut to a further off frontal shot of Raava.] I don't want your help. [Sternly.] Don't interfere with me again, human!",8,2,20
,"Raava flies away, weaving herself through the sky. Cut to a side-shot of Wan and Mula as they turn to one another with wondering looks on their faces.",8,2,20
Wan,Let's get moving.,8,2,20
,"Far off shot of Wan and Mula standing in the clearing. They start to walk to the right. Cut to a shot of a trail leading through the woods. Mula walks into view with Wan perched on its back. They stop and look to their left as they hear a noise coming from the bushes. The camera pans right to follow their gaze, revealing a fruit tree, its branches shaking slightly. Cut to a frontal shot of a shrub as Mula emerges from it. Both the animal and Wan look toward the scene before them. Cut to a far frontal shot, revealing four monks who are busy harvesting the fruits from the tree. Two of the monks bring their left hand toward their chest, their fingers stretched, which creates a cloud underneath them. The camera pans up to follow the monks floating to the top branches of the tree, where another monk, on a cloud of his own, is already plucking the fruit. Close-up of a fruit that is being plucked by a monk, and zoom out to reveal that the monk wears similar clothing and tattoos to the later Air Nomads.",8,2,20
Wan,"[Voice-over; excited.] Do you see that, Mula? [Frontal shot; Mula turns to look at Wan.] People. And they have some kind of wind power. [Cut to a back shot of the nomads. Wan rides up to them; laughs; excitedly.] More humans! [Cut to a frontal shot of the nomads.] I found you. [The nomads startle and run away in fright, one dropping his basket.] Wait! I'm friendly!",8,2,20
,"Wan gives chase, which nearly ends up killing him when Mula stops abruptly before a cliff, tossing him. He manages to grab an overhanging branch and pulls himself back up. As he emerges above the cliff again, he sees one of the nomads running up to him and use his airbending to fly toward a floating lion turtle.",8,2,20
Wan,"The legends are true. Another lion turtle city. And it's flying. [The scene briefly shifts to the lion turtle taking back the airbending of the foragers. Cut back to an amazed Wan.] I have got to get over there. [Ties a rope to a tree and around a rock.] There. Okay, Mula. Wish me luck. [Wan climbs on the tree and burns the rope with his firebending, catapulting himself toward the lion turtle. However, he does not fly far enough, falling down.] Oh, no--. [He manages to grab hold of dangling vines; fade to an aerial view of the village; cut to inside the city as Wan explores the village. A green transparent bird-like spirit flies by him much to Wan's surprise and amazement. Wan smiles in amazement as he watches it go past him.] Wow. [Cut to a wide shot of a group of meditating nomads. Wan approaches the nomads.] Hi, how are you? I'm Wan. [The nomads stay silent and look at each other.] Um, sorry to interrupt, but it's been a while since I've seen other humans.",8,2,20
Nomad,"Where did you come from, stranger?",8,2,20
Wan,[Frontal shot.] Another lion turtle city far away. For the past two years I've been living among the spirits and exploring the wilds.,8,2,20
Nomad,[Amazed.] Remarkable. Come. Sit with us. We would love to hear of your travels.,8,2,20
,"A spirit sitting on the nomad's shoulder becomes dark and flies off much to the nomads' surprise and shock. Another dark spirit cuts through a wall of a nearby hut. People run out screaming. Next moment, there are dark spirits all over the village and Vaatu floats in the sky.",8,2,20
Wan,Vaatu.,8,2,20
Vaatu,"So, we meet again, human.",8,2,20
Nomad,Why is the great spirit of the darkness here but not his other half? [Wan slightly flinches nervously.],8,2,20
Wan,"Uh, I'll explain later. [Runs offscreen. Cut to a wide-shot of the sky as Wan runs up to Vaatu. To Vaatu.] Leave these people in peace. They've done nothing to harm you. [Firebends at a dark spirit who attacks a woman, and proceeds to fight the other spirits.]",8,2,20
Raava,[Appears and knocks Vaatu away.] Be gone.,8,2,20
Vaatu,"How are you feeling since our split, Raava? I've never been better. When Harmonic Convergence comes, I will destroy you forever. [Leaves. Wan sighs in relief.]",8,2,20
Raava,[To Wan.] I told you not to interfere.,8,2,20
Wan,I had to do something. These people were in danger.,8,2,20
Nomad,"Great spirit of light, we thank you for your help. But how did you become split from Vaatu? [Wan's face turns to a worried one.]",8,2,20
Raava,Ask him. [The nomad turns his head to Wan. Wan slowly turns to the nomad.],8,2,20
Wan,It wasn't my fault. Vaatu tricked me into freeing him. I'd take it all back if I could.,8,2,20
Raava,"It's too late for that. Now that Vaatu is free, he is turning other spirits dark. The more spirits he turns, the stronger he becomes.",8,2,20
Wan,"He's getting bigger, and you're getting smaller.",8,2,20
Raava,"As darkness grows, light fades. [Wan lowers his head in shame.]",8,2,20
Wan,"I'm sorry for endangering your village, but I promise to set things right.",8,2,20
Nomad,[Turns his head to another nomad in confusion and back to Wan.] How?,8,2,20
,"Cut to Wan, along with Raava, Mula and a nomad, facing the air lion turtle.",8,2,20
Wan,"Great lion turtle, I ask that you grant me the power of air so that I can defeat Vaatu before it's too late. [To the lion turtle.]",8,2,20
Air lion turtle,You already carry the power of fire. No human has ever held two elements at the same time.,8,2,20
Wan,I'm not like other humans. I can learn to do it.,8,2,20
Air lion turtle,"Hmm, perhaps. But to do so, Raava must hold the power for you until you master it.",8,2,20
Raava,"Ancient one, why would I do that for a human? Especially one who's caused so much trouble?",8,2,20
Wan,"Raava, please, I can't let the world fall into chaos because of my mistake. Neither of us can defeat Vaatu alone, but together we have a chance.",8,2,20
Raava,You may be right. Very well. I will help you to master the power of air.,8,2,20
Wan,[Cut to a frontal shot of Wan with the camera slowly zooming in on him.] Thank you. And in return I will help you restore balance to the world.,8,2,20
,Cut to Raava and Wan walking through deserted lands.,8,2,20
Wan,What's this harmonic thing Vaatu was talking about?,8,2,20
Raava,Harmonic Convergence. That is when Vaatu and I must battle for the fate of the world.,8,2,20
Wan,How long do we have until then?,8,2,20
Raava,About a year in your time.,8,2,20
Wan,"Then we better start training. [Firebends.] All right, I'm ready to try air. How's this gonna work?",8,2,20
Raava,The only way for me to give you the other element is to pass through your body and combine our energies.,8,2,20
Wan,Great. So you've done this before.,8,2,20
Raava,No. This has never even been attempted. It is very dangerous.,8,2,20
Wan,"That's what they said about living in the Spirit Wilds, and I survived that. I'm ready. Give me the air. [Shouts as Raava passes through his body. After he regains his composure, he sends out a burst of air.] It feels completely different. If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other? [Continues practicing his airbending.]",8,2,20
Raava,"He cannot destroy light any more than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other. Even if I defeat Vaatu in this encounter, darkness will grow inside me until he emerges again. The same will hold true if Vaatu defeats me.",8,2,20
Wan,"That doesn't sound so bad. Even if Vaatu wins, you'll come back.",8,2,20
Raava,"Yes, but you will probably not survive to see it. Vaatu will destroy the world as you know it. Darkness will cover the Earth for ten thousand years. [Cut to Wan who is thinking with his head down.]",8,2,20
Wan,"[Raises his head to Raava.] If I'm gonna help you battle Vaatu, then I should visit more lion turtles. [Water lion turtle gives Wan the power of water. Wan immediately raises some water; voice-over.] Why is there so much conflict between humans and spirits in the first place?",8,2,20
Raava,"[Voice-over.] This physical world is where humans come from. Spirits come from another realm. At the north and south poles, the two realms intersect. Over time, more and more spirits have drifted into this world. [Cut to the earth lion turtle rising and giving Wan the power of earth.] Humans have been forced apart, settling on the lion turtles who protect them and losing touch with each other.",8,2,20
Wan,[Waterbends; voice-over.] Most people think they live in the only human city in the world.,8,2,20
Raava,"[Voice-over.] Most humans think only of themselves, [Passes through Wan's body.] no matter how many others are around.",8,2,20
Wan,"When you pass through me, I feel an incredible rush of power. [Earthbends. Raava passes through him again.] I feel like I'm changing. The more we practice, the stronger I become. [Sniffs.] Smells like smoke.",8,2,20
Raava,Humans are nearby.,8,2,20
Wan,Let's check it out.,8,2,20
,Raava and Wan see a group of humans burning down a forest for wood and approach the humans.,8,2,20
Settler,A spirit! [Hurls a fireball toward Raava.],8,2,20
Wan,"[Wan jumps in front, deflecting the fire.] Easy there, fellas. We're friendly.",8,2,20
Jaya,[Cut back to the settlers. Walks up to Wan.] I can't believe it. Wan? [Cut to a side-shot of the two.],8,2,20
Wan,Jaya! [They walk toward each other and hug.] What are you doing out here? [They release each other.],8,2,20
Jaya,"[Laughs.] You inspired us. Once we heard that you survived out in the wilds, we decided to try it too.",8,2,20
Wan,[Hopeful.] Where's Yao? [Jaya's expression turns to sadness.] Did he come with you?,8,2,20
Jaya,"[Hangs his head in sorrow.] Yes, but sadly he didn't make it. [Wan hangs his head in sadness and sorrow.] We ... we lost a lot of good men along the way. [Cut to a wide-shot of the group.] So why were you protecting this spirit?",8,2,20
Wan,This is Raava. Don't worry. She's not like the dark spirits you've probably run into.,8,2,20
Jaya,[Frontal shot of Jaya in front of the settlers.] Dark spirits? What's the difference? We throw fire at any spirit we see around here. Just like they attack any man.,8,2,20
Raava,[Angry.] You have no idea what you're doing. You're only making things worse.,8,2,20
Settler,[A settler points to the right.] The spirits are coming back! [Cut back to the frontal shot.],8,2,20
Jaya,[Turns to his settlers.] Let's wipe 'em out this time! [The settlers run off to fight the spirits.] We'll burn down this whole forest if we have to!,8,2,20
Wan,What happened to you? When did you become so violent?,8,2,20
Jaya,[Turns to Wan.] You showed me we could change the world if we just stopped being so afraid. Now we're doing it. [Runs off to join the settlers. Cuts back to a sorrowful Wan.],8,2,20
Wan,This isn't what I had in mind.,8,2,20
,"Cut to an aerial shot of a group of spirits and the firebending settlers approach each other; cut to a frontal shot of the settlers as they lit up their hands. cut to a close-up of the spirits, revealing that the aye-aye spirit is leading them.",8,2,20
Aye-aye spirit,"[Steps forward.] Get out of the forest, humans.",8,2,20
Wan,[Runs in between the groups.] Wait! We can resolve this peacefully.,8,2,20
Aye-aye spirit,Stinky? [Becomes happy.] You came back.,8,2,20
Wan,It's good to see you again.,8,2,20
Aye-aye spirit,You and Raava are just in time to help us clear these tree-killing fire-lovers out of here just like the old days.,8,2,20
Jaya,You are the one who's getting cleared out.,8,2,20
Wan,There's no need for violence. I know there must be a way to work out a compromise.,8,2,20
Aye-aye spirit,"You have a good heart, Stinky. But these fire tossers aren't like you.",8,2,20
Jaya,Spirits like him killed our friends! I can't let them get away with that.,8,2,20
,"The rumbling of thunder is heard. Cut to a far off side-shot of the battlefield as clouds roll in overhead. A lightning bolt splits the sky, illuminating Vaatu's form in the sky. He laughs wickedly. Cut to a close-up of the angry-looking aye-aye spirit as he and the other spirits turn dark.",8,2,20
Dark aye-aye spirit,[Deep voice.] We are protectors of the forest. We won't let you burn it down.,8,2,20
Raava,"It's Vaatu. He's growing stronger, using their anger to turn them to his side.",8,2,20
Dark aye-aye spirit,[Avoids a fire ball tossed at him by Jaya.] Wipe them out!,8,2,20
,"Man and spirit charge each other, though are kept apart by the efforts of Wan and Raava.",8,2,20
Wan,"Stop, please! [Continues airbending to keep the two groups apart, but they keep charging at each other.] Raava, we need to combine our energies. Maybe then we'll have enough power to stop this. [Raava and Wan merge, and Wan shoots himself in the air, riding an air spout while the other elements circle around him. At the same time, he is enveloped in white energy.] Enough! [Cut to a shot of Wan.] You need to stop fighting now, [Turns his head to the settlers.] before you destroy each other!",8,2,20
Aye-aye spirit,"[Groans as he is pushed back and turns back to normal. Notices Wan as he holds his head with his ears drooped.] Stinky, w-what happened?",8,2,20
Jaya,[Awed.] He's controlling all four elements.,8,2,20
Raava,"[Wan's energy begins to become visibly unstable.] Wan, I have to leave your body, or I'll destroy you.",8,2,20
Wan,"No. It's working. If you leave, the fighting will start again.",8,2,20
,"Wan groans under the strain Raava's presence is putting on his body until he cannot take it anymore, and he faints, falling down out of the sky.",8,2,20
Raava,Wan!,8,2,20
,"Raava leaves his body, catches him before he crashes on the ground, and carries him off the battlefield. As they leave, the two groups clash with one another, continuing the battle. Groaning, Wan awakens on a nearby cliff overlooking the burned down remains of the battlefield.",8,2,20
Wan,We have to go back.,8,2,20
Vaatu,[Flies in front of him.] Don't bother. Your human friends have already been annihilated.,8,2,20
Wan,[Shocked.] No!,8,2,20
Vaatu,Enjoy your final days. See you at the end of the world!,8,2,20
,"Vaatu flies away, leaving Wan to search for Raava. He finds her severely shrunken behind a rock. He picks up the weak spirit that he can now easily take into his arms.",8,2,20
Wan,Raava ...,8,2,20
Raava,"I'm sorry, Wan.",8,2,20
,"Wan slides Raava into a teapot, and jumps on Mula, setting course for the southern spirit portal.",8,2,20
Raava,"We're almost there. [Wan looks into the teapot.] I was wrong about you, Wan. I had no idea that humans were capable of such nobility and courage. I'm sorry that we do not have much more time together.",8,2,20
Wan,"Let's not give up before the battle's even begun. Who knows what will happen? [A slight smile appears on his face.] After all, this is my first Harmonic Convergence.",8,2,20
Raava,"This is the southern portal to the Spirit World. Here, Vaatu and I will do battle once again, at the place where the two worlds meet.",8,2,20
,"Mula, Wan, and Raava pass through the portal. As they enter, the scenes around the portal fade into those of the Spirit World. They emerge in the Spirit World at a scene that is barren with the exception of a hollow tree, several streams, and two portals. Cut to a aerial view of the battlefield. Vaatu emerges from the northern portal.",8,2,20
Vaatu,"Are you ready for our final battle, Raava? Thanks to our friend separating us, I think this time I may be rid of you once and for all.",8,2,20
Wan,"Before you get to her, you'll have to go through me.",8,2,20
Vaatu,[Slightly chuckles.] No human can stand against me.,8,2,20
Wan,Haven't you heard the legends? I'm not a regular human anymore.,8,2,20
,"Wan firebends at Vaatu, who flies away to avoid the blasts. However, he turns back and knocks Wan away with one of his tentacles.",8,2,20
Vaatu,I lived ten thousand lifetimes before the first of your kind crawled out of the mud!,8,2,20
,Fires a purple energy beam out of his face. Wan screams as he is knocked backward again.,8,2,20
Vaatu,It was I who broke through the divide that separated the plane of spirits from the material world! [Fires the purple beam again. Wan grunts as he ricochets over the ground.] To hate me is to give me breath. To fight me is to give me strength. Now prepare to face oblivion!,8,2,20
,"Vaatu fires a purple energy beam at Wan, who propels himself with his firebending to avoid it.",8,2,20
Wan,"[Turns to Raava desperately.] Raava! The only way to win is together. [Raava flies to Wan and merges with him, who is briefly surrounded by unstable white energy.] Ah!",8,2,20
,"Vaatu attacks with his whpping tentacles, which Wan evades by flying on a cloud. The two of them exchange blows, with Wan being more powerful and is making a decent stand against Vaatu. Vaatu still has the upper hand in the fight though, even though Wan is now capable of bending two elements simultaneously. Wan is forced back, his physical form starting to become static as his energy becomes unstable.",8,2,20
Raava,"I have to leave you. If I stay any longer, you will die.",8,2,20
Wan,"It doesn't matter. If you leave me now, Vaatu will destroy everything. We have to finish this together!",8,2,20
,"Wan and Vaatu exchange more blows, the former becoming more static while losing ground. Wan promptly charges at Vaatu, and although he manages to land a fire blast, he is shot backward toward the southern portal by a purple energy beam. He skids to a halt right before the portal, where Vaatu pins hims down using one of his tentacles.",8,2,20
Vaatu,The Harmonic Convergence is about to begin. The era of Raava is over.,8,2,20
,"Cut to a shot of outer space as the planets align, the two beams from the spirit portals bend over to connect with one another. Vaatu starts to glow purple as he watches the spectacle in the sky. While still static, Wan lights up briefly, showing Raava's form inside his chest. He puts his right hand behind him, causing the energy of the southern spirit portal during Harmonic Convergence to flow though him, basking him in blue light, as he permanently merges his spirit with Raava's. Vaatu notices and releases him in shock. Wan's form becomes less static and his eyes glow white. He cries out and white lights shoot out of his mouth and eyes, enveloping the area.",8,2,20
,"Vaatu moves away a safe distance before turning back. As the light subsides, Wan emerges and his energy has stabilized. Music intensifies.",8,2,20
Raava,We are bonded forever.,8,2,20
,"Wan, eyes still glowing, attacks Vaatu, hitting him consistently and pressuring him before trapping him in an air bubble, which he secures with rings of all four elements. He uses his bending to guide the bubble to the hollow of a tree in which he imprisons Vaatu behind a purple energy field.",8,2,20
Wan,This is your prison now. And I will close the portals so no human will ever be able to physically enter the Spirit World and release you.,8,2,20
,"Wan closes the northern portal. Back in the mortal world, spirits are lining up to return to the Spirit World through the southern portal.",8,2,20
Wan,[Voice-over.] The spirits must stop fighting with humans and return to their home in the Spirit World. I will teach men to respect the spirits so that balance will be maintained.,8,2,20
,"Before the aye-aye spirit enters the spirit portal, he turns to Wan and bows respectfully, a gesture that is returned by the first Avatar.",8,2,20
Wan,[Voice-over.] I will be the bridge between our two worlds. [He closes the portal. Cut to a close up of Wan. Cut to the fire lion turtle with his city's former residents looking at him.],8,2,20
Fire lion turtle,[To his city's former residents.] The world is entering a new age. Our time protecting mankind is over. We will no longer give humans the power of the elements.,8,2,20
Wan,"[Cuts to a gray still scene of armored warriors fighting with weapons, fire and water bending; voice-over.] Different groups of people must learn to live together. [The scene pans up to show a still of a determined-looking Wan entering the Avatar State.] This is my mission: to use Raava's light spirit [Scene moves back to show Wan using the four elements to separate the fighting parties which are distinguished by red and blue flags.] to guide the world toward peace.",8,2,20
,"Cut to a burning battlefield. Rocks are elevated everywhere, red flags, arrows, and large earth coins lie scattered over the field. An old and armored Wan slumps against an earth coin, surrounded by arrows.",8,2,20
Old Wan,"[With his eyes closed.] I'm sorry, Raava. I failed to bring peace. Even with Vaatu locked away, darkness still surrounds humanity. [Opens his eyes.] There wasn't enough time.",8,2,20
Raava,Don't worry. We will be together for all of your lifetimes. And we will never give up.,8,2,20
,"As Wan exhales for a last time, a golden light escapes his mouth. It dissipates into little golden specks and scatters. The scene fades to a white screen as the sound of a baby crying is heard. Fades to Korra's closed eyes that suddenly shoot open, glowing a bright white. Cut to a side-shot of her as she jolts up, little white beams shooting out of her eyes. She gasps for air, and the light in her eyes stop. Cut to the shaman and two Bhanti tribesmen looking down upon her from the mouth of the cave Korra is in. Side-shot of Korra.",8,2,20
Korra,I remember.,8,2,20
Shaman,Do you know who you are?,8,2,20
Korra,[Looks up to the members of the Bhanti.] My name is Korra. I'm the Avatar.,8,2,20
,"Cut to outside the cave, where Korra and the shaman reach a grass clearing where bison are grazing.",8,2,20
Shaman,We've been raising this herd of air bison since the Hundred Year War. I never thought I'd be able to present one to the Avatar.,8,2,20
Korra,Thank you for all your kindness. I wonder how long I've been away.,8,2,20
Shaman,"That I cannot say, but you do not have much time left. The Harmonic Convergence is only weeks away.",8,2,20
Korra,I have to close the spirit portal before that happens.,8,2,20
,"Cut to a shot of Korra atop a flying bison missing a part of its right horn, flying through the sky.",8,2,20

,The episode opens at the Eastern Air Temple. Cut to Jinora playing with a light green dragonfly bunny spirit.,9,2,21
Jinora,"Gotcha! [Jumps and tries to grab the spirit, but it escapes.] Furry-Foot, come back.",9,2,21
,The spirit returns and lands on Jinora's head; four other dragonfly bunny spirits come close. Jinora laughs.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Walks over.] Jinora, there you are. Come on, everyone's waiting. [Cut to Jinora from Tenzin's point of view, showing that she is standing all by herself, indicating that she is the only one who can see the spirits.] Were you playing with someone?",9,2,21
Jinora,"Oh, just some ... imaginary friends.",9,2,21
,Jinora giggles as Furry-Foot appears on Tenzin's head while he walks away. Cut to two Air Acolytes standing in the gallery.,9,2,21
Kya,[Voice-over.] Stop telling lies.,9,2,21
,"Cut to courtyard, where Tenzin's family is gathered. Tenzin and Jinora walk in.",9,2,21
Bumi,It's true. I once beat an earthbender in a rock-throwing contest! I have the trophy to prove it.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"All right, who's ready for an exciting tour of the Eastern Air Temple? We've got a lot to see today, including ancient statues, ancient gardens, [Cut to Ikki and Meelo, who are obviously bored.] and the meditation hall used by ancient airbenders.",9,2,21
Ikki,[Bored and disinterested.] Yay. Old things.,9,2,21
,Korra enters the courtyard.,9,2,21
Tenzin,[In disbelief.] Korra?,9,2,21
"Jinora, Ikki and Meelo","[Excitedly.] Korra! Yay, Korra! Korra's back! [Run forward and hug Korra.]",9,2,21
Pema,What are you doing here?,9,2,21
Ikki,"[Voice-over.] Oh, I've missed you!",9,2,21
Kya,And how did you know where to find us?,9,2,21
Korra,Tenzin's itinerary. We went over it like a hundred times before we left Republic City.,9,2,21
Tenzin,[To his siblings.] See? This is why schedules are important.,9,2,21
Korra,It's so great to see you all again.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"It's great to see you too, but why aren't you training at the South Pole?",9,2,21
Korra,"[Slightly confused.] Wait, you don't know about the Civil War?",9,2,21
Tenzin,[Surprised.] What? No. We've been out of touch with the outside world since we started our vacation.,9,2,21
Bumi,Tenzin's idea. What happened?,9,2,21
Korra,So much. I-I don't know where to start.,9,2,21
Tenzin,Just tell us everything!,9,2,21
Korra,"Everything? [Breathes deep.] Okay. I opened a spirit portal at the South Pole, but then Unalaq turned out to be a bad guy and wanted to take control of the South, so I sort of started a Civil War, but when I went to find some help, I was attacked by my cousins, and then by a giant dark spirit, and then I forgot who I was, and then I met the first Avatar, and then I realized I shouldn't have opened the portal in the first place, and now I need to close it again!",9,2,21
Tenzin,I knew this would happen. [Cut to the garden where Tenzin and Korra are seated.] So Avatar Wan imprisoned this dark spirit Vaatu in the Spirit World?,9,2,21
Korra,"Yes, and now I think my uncle is trying to free him.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"I knew Unalaq was hungry for power, but never realized how far he would go to get it.",9,2,21
Korra,This is all my fault.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"No, don't blame yourself. This is Unalaq's doing. Now, we must focus on setting things right before he can do any more damage.",9,2,21
Korra,Thank you.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"So, you need to close the Southern portal, but if Unalaq's army controls the South, how are we going to get to it?",9,2,21
Korra,I thought about that. My best chance to close the portal is from the inside. [Determined.] I have to enter the Spirit World.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"A journey to the Spirit World. All my years of spiritual training have prepared me for this moment. [Stands.] I will help you. Today, we enter the Spirit World.",9,2,21
,"Cut to the Southern Spirit Portal, where Unalaq and his children are standing.",9,2,21
Desna,"Father, what are we doing here?",9,2,21
Unalaq,You're here to straighten out the mess you caused when you failed to capture the Avatar.,9,2,21
Desna,"I told you, it wasn't our fault.",9,2,21
Unalaq,You're right. It was my fault for trusting you. Harmonic Convergence is almost upon us. This is my opportunity to change the world.,9,2,21
Eska,"We'll make it up to you, Father.",9,2,21
Unalaq,"Good, because I'll need your help to open the northern portal.",9,2,21
Desna,[Surprised with his sister.] I thought only the Avatar could do it.,9,2,21
Unalaq,I believe there is another way.,9,2,21
,"Unalaq and his children enter the portal. Cut to the Spirit World, where they emerge.",9,2,21
Unalaq,This way.,9,2,21
,Cut to the trio walking up to the tree where Vaatu is imprisoned as they look at the closed northern portal.,9,2,21
Unalaq,"There it is, the northern portal.",9,2,21
,"Cut to an aerial view of the Spirit World, which is the same area where Wan and Raava battled with Vaatu ten thousand years ago. Cut to the filming set of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South. Close-up of Bolin's face, screaming. The camera rotates to reveal him, dressed as Nuktuk, suspended upside-down by props resembling eagle talons.",9,2,21
Director,"Cut! Okay, that's lunch, everyone.",9,2,21
,"A bell rings and the scene fades to where all the crew members have left the set. Only Bolin is left there, still suspended by the props.",9,2,21
Bolin,"Hello? Anyone? Nuktuk's still up here, all alone. [A door slams, and Asami enters the set, seen from Bolin's aerial point of view.] Asami! Hey, what are you doing here?",9,2,21
Asami,"Varrick invited me to watch some of the filming. [Cut to frontal shot on her level. She looks around, confused.] Are you filming right now?",9,2,21
Bolin,Right now? Nope. We're uh ... we're at lunch.,9,2,21
Mako,"[Walks in.] Asami, there you are. Is Bolin around?",9,2,21
Bolin,[Voice-over.] Up here. [Struggles to free himself.],9,2,21
Mako,Good. I've got something to tell you both.,9,2,21
Bolin,"[Managed to free himself before plunging down.] Ahh! Ow, aww. Oh, I got to stop doing my own stunts.",9,2,21
Mako,I found out who's been stealing from Future Industries: [Whispers.] Varrick.,9,2,21
Bolin,What? No.,9,2,21
Asami,[Confused.] He attacked his own ship?,9,2,21
Mako,"Yes! It was a ploy. He wants Republic City to go to war, and he wants control of the businesses that stand to profit the most from it. He already had all the shipping. All he needed was Future Industries.",9,2,21
Asami,"Varrick helped save Future Industries. He's my business partner now, not an evil mastermind. [Concerned.] Mako, you seemed stressed.",9,2,21
Mako,I am stressed!,9,2,21
Bolin,"See, this is why I had to move out.",9,2,21
Asami,You guys aren't living together anymore?,9,2,21
Bolin,Nope. It was time for this eagle hawk to spread his wings and fly. [Flaps his hands.],9,2,21
Asami,[To Mako.] Sounds like you've had a pretty busy week. [Puts her hand on his chest.] Maybe you just need to relax.,9,2,21
Bolin,[Pensively.] Wait a minute. Are you two— [Mako and Asami look back at him before he gasps and points his finger toward them.] you're dating again? What?,9,2,21
Mako,Dating? No!,9,2,21
Asami,That's crazy!,9,2,21
Bolin,Korra just left a week ago!,9,2,21
Mako,"[Cut to aerial view.] Guys, listen to me. Varrick is up to no good, and I have proof. The detonators he uses in his movers are exactly like the one I found at the cultural center attack. [Cut to close-up of Mako's face.] And those explosions were exactly like the ones the captain reported when Asami's shipment was hijacked. Don't you see?",9,2,21
Asami,[Cut to side-shot.] Anyone could have gotten their hands on one of those detonators.,9,2,21
Bolin,"Yeah. Let it go, Mako. [Leans forward; quietly.] Let it go.",9,2,21
Mako,[Irritated.] Gah! No! I'm not going to let it go!,9,2,21
,Mako turns around and walks off. Bolin stared after him along with Asami. Cut to Mako walking down the corridor where he is stopped by two bodyguards.,9,2,21
Bodyguard,[Aerial shot.] Varrick's been looking for you. [Cut back to Mako's frontal view.],9,2,21
,"Cut to the Eastern Air Temple, where Tenzin and Korra are standing at a platform.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Voice-over.] You're lucky. This temple is the most spiritual of all the air temples. [Cut to side-shot of Tenzin and Korra.] Why, this very garden is where my father met Guru Pathik.",9,2,21
Korra,"Wow! Spirit World, here we come.",9,2,21
,"Cut to a field where Korra and Tenzin are meditating. Meelo is ringing a bell, while Ikki is playing a horn by airbending, producing a low droning sound.",9,2,21
Korra,[Opens her right eye and peers at Tenzin; whispering.] Are you in the Spirit World?,9,2,21
Tenzin,[Cut to Tenzin's left eye opening.] I would be if Meelo could ring his bell at the appropriate intervals.,9,2,21
Meelo,"[Saddened.] Aww, did I do it wrong?",9,2,21
Tenzin,[Cut to a view from behind Meelo's back; Tenzin stands up and sighs in exasperation.] Let's try something else. [Walks off.],9,2,21
Korra,"[Stands up, to Meelo.] I thought your bell ringing was just fine.",9,2,21
Meelo,Thanks! [Continuously rings the bell.],9,2,21
,"Cut to a mountainside where an Air Nomad's face is carved on. Tenzin and Korra are once again meditating, now surrounded by burning incense sticks attached to talismans with the airbending symbol that Kya placed there. Close-up of Tenzin's face.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Opens his eyes and looks left, then right. Coughs from the approaching smoke.] Kya, this is too much smoke. You set it up wrong. This isn't going to work.",9,2,21
Kya,[Holding two lit incense sticks.] I'm sorry. I did what you told me.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Walks off.] Well, the moment's ruined. [Kya scowls.]",9,2,21
,"Cut to Jinora's point of view, where she notices multiple dragonfly bunny spirits circling around Korra.",9,2,21
Korra,[Stands.] We could have tried a little longer. [Catches up with Tenzin.],9,2,21
,"Cut back to Jinora's point of view, where the spirits fly off into the wilderness. The green-colored spirit looks back before flying off, as it gesturing for her.",9,2,21
Jinora,"[Runs to the cliffside.] Come back, Furry-Foot.",9,2,21
Kya,"Hey, Jinora, what are you chasing?",9,2,21
Jinora,Nothing.,9,2,21
,"Jinora catches up with her father, while her aunt looks on with suspicion. Cut to the temple interior where Tenzin and Korra are meditating beneath a statue of Avatar Yangchen.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"Focus, Korra. Focus.",9,2,21
Korra,I am focusing.,9,2,21
Tenzin,No talking. Feel the energy of the universe.,9,2,21
Korra,"Okay, I feel it.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Opens his eyes.] Korra, really! I'm trying to concentrate here! I don't think this location is going to work either.",9,2,21
Korra,"What's going on with you? First, you're blaming Meelo, then Kya, and now me.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"Well, nothing is feeling right to me.",9,2,21
Korra,"I don't want to rush your feelings, but we're kind of in a hurry. How did you first get into the Spirit World? Let's try that.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"Well ... actually, I've never been into the Spirit World.",9,2,21
,"Korra is shocked by the revelation, while Tenzin's family members peer into the temple from the outside.",9,2,21
Korra,You've never been into the Spirit World?,9,2,21
Pema,But you used to spend days in the temple meditating.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"Trying to get in. It never happened. It's my greatest shortcoming as an airbender, spiritual leader, and son of Aang.",9,2,21
Bumi,"[Laughs.] Welcome to the ""I Disappoint Dad"" club.",9,2,21
Kya,"If you've never been to the Spirit World, how were you planning to get Korra into it?",9,2,21
Tenzin,"I've spent years studying the techniques and theories of ancient spiritual leaders. Now that the Avatar needs me, it must be my time.",9,2,21
Korra,"Tenzin, Harmonic Convergence is almost here. If Vaatu escapes from the Spirit World—",9,2,21
Tenzin,You have to trust me. I can help you.,9,2,21
Kya,"There might be another way. Jinora, is there something you want to tell Korra?",9,2,21
Tenzin,Jinora? She's too young and untrained to have any knowledge about spiritual matters.,9,2,21
Jinora,"Actually, I think I do know where Korra needs to go to get into the Spirit World.",9,2,21
Tenzin,And how would you know that?,9,2,21
Jinora,"My spirit friends showed me. [To dragonfly bunny spirits.] It's okay. You can show yourselves. [The spirits appear into everyone's sight, surprising them.]",9,2,21
Tenzin,How did you do that?,9,2,21
Pema,[Awestruck.] Jinora.,9,2,21
Meelo,[Excitedly.] Bunnies!,9,2,21
Jinora,"Actually, they're dragonfly bunny spirits.",9,2,21
Kya,I knew it. Looks like she does know something about spiritual matters.,9,2,21
,"The dragonfly bunny spirits fly out of the temple, while Ikki and Meelo give chase.",9,2,21
Ikki,So cute!,9,2,21
Meelo,Bunnies!,9,2,21
Ikki,Come back!,9,2,21
Tenzin,How long have you been able to do this?,9,2,21
Jinora,I don't know. [A blue colored spirit flies back to the entrance.] I guess I've always kind of had a connection with spirits. [The spirit flies into the temple and next to Bumi.],9,2,21
Bumi,[Laughs.] I think this one likes me.,9,2,21
Korra,Are they here to help? [The spirits descend beneath the cliffside.],9,2,21
Jinora,I think they want you to go down there.,9,2,21
Tenzin,I don't know. The spiritual energy is historically strongest near the temple.,9,2,21
Korra,"No offense, but I'm guessing the spirits have actually been to the Spirit World, so I'm gonna follow them.",9,2,21
Bumi,"[Teasingly.] If we need to go to the Tenzin World, we'll call you.",9,2,21
,"Cut back to the Spirit World, where Unalaq and his children approach the closed Northern portal.",9,2,21
Eska,"Father, haven't the spirits had ten thousand years to open this portal?",9,2,21
Desna,"If they could not succeed, what makes you think we will?",9,2,21
Unalaq,"By entering the Spirit World through the portal, we bring with us something the spirits never had: our bending. [Bends a water stream into the portal, while his children watch on.] Join me! Together, we can open this portal.",9,2,21
,"Eska and Desna assist their father by bending their respective water streams. The portal reacts, sending purple energy which disrupts their streams and injures Desna, throwing him backward and groaning in pain.",9,2,21
Eska,[Shocked and worried.] Desna!,9,2,21
Unalaq,Leave him! Keep bending! [Bends another stream of water while his daughter tends to her brother.],9,2,21
Eska,[Tending to her brother.] He needs a healer at once!,9,2,21
Unalaq,This is more important!,9,2,21
Eska,[Carries her brother.] I'm taking him back.,9,2,21
,"Eska carries her brother away from the Spirit World. Unalaq continues bending at the portal, but he is unsuccessful. He bends more water, freezing it into an ice drill, but still to no avail. Unalaq looks on in disappointment. Cut to Varrick's office which is glowing orange. The door opens and the two bodyguards shove Mako in. The camera zooms out to show Varrick and the floor which is covered with burning coal.",9,2,21
Varrick,I hear you've got some ideas. You wanna tell me about them?,9,2,21
Mako,Go ahead. Torture me all you want. I'm not gonna talk.,9,2,21
Varrick,"Torture? The only thing I want to torture is this pesky foot fungus. [Shows his infected foot; screams in pain as he walks through the coal.] Ah! Eee! Ooh! The burning means it's working. [The bodyguards leave upon receiving a look from Varrick.] I heard you've been investigating the recent attacks on my ships, and I think you know that I know that you know, you know?",9,2,21
Mako,Know what?,9,2,21
Varrick,"That the world is a dangerous place, and that's exactly why I want to offer you a job on my security force.",9,2,21
Mako,I have a job.,9,2,21
Varrick,"We need you. Me, Asami, Bolin. We're all in the same team here. We want you to join us. You wouldn't want anything to happen to Asami, would you? I mean, I heard you and her were kind of, uh, an item again. Or what about your brother?",9,2,21
Mako,What are you saying?,9,2,21
Varrick,"[Slightly threatening.] I'm saying I want your help to protect them. Without you, who knows what could happen.",9,2,21
Mako,"Thanks for your concern, but the answer is no.",9,2,21
,"Mako leaves, while Varrick returns to walking on the hot coal. Cut back to the Eastern Air Temple, where Korra, Tenzin, Kya, Bumi and Jinora are riding atop Oogi while following the dragonfly bunny spirits.",9,2,21
Bumi,"[Holding a blue-colored spirit, chuckling.] Oh, you are just so cute. I'm going to name you Bum-Ju. It's short for ""Bumi Junior"". [Places the spirit beside him, to Tenzin.] Don't you think he looks like me?",9,2,21
Tenzin,[Without looking back.] The resemblance is uncanny.,9,2,21
Jinora,"[Sadly, next to her aunt.] I think Dad's mad at me.",9,2,21
Kya,[Consoling.] Your father's not mad. His pride's just a little bruised since he isn't able to see spirits like you.,9,2,21
Korra,You have a natural gift. That's pretty lucky.,9,2,21
Jinora,"You're the lucky one. You actually got to meet the first Avatar. I know about a lot of Avatars, but I don't know anything about him. Is it even a him? Or is it her?",9,2,21
Korra,"It's a him, Avatar Wan. He was amazing. I saw how he became the first Avatar by fusing with Raava, the Spirit of Light.",9,2,21
Jinora,The Avatar is part spirit? Of course! Just like the statue.,9,2,21
Kya,What statue?,9,2,21
Jinora,"When we were at the Southern Air Temple, I was drawn to this old carving. I couldn't figure out what it was until now. It was the first Avatar.",9,2,21
Korra,When did this happen?,9,2,21
Jinora,It was on the solstice.,9,2,21
Korra,That's the day I opened the Southern portal.,9,2,21
Korra and Jinora,Whoa.,9,2,21
Bumi,[As Oogi lands.] We're here!,9,2,21
Tenzin,Are you sure these spirits are leading us into the right place?,9,2,21
Bumi,Of course! I trust Bum-Ju with my life.,9,2,21
,The dragonfly bunny spirits lead the group to a circle surrounded by rocks. The rocks are overgrown with vines and have an airbending symbol on it.,9,2,21
Korra,Look. There are carvings on them.,9,2,21
Tenzin,This is an ancient airbender meditation circle.,9,2,21
Jinora,"There's a lot of spiritual energy in this place, but it feels really strange.",9,2,21
Tenzin,We'll have to perform a spiritual cleansing ceremony.,9,2,21
Bumi,What are you talking about?,9,2,21
Tenzin,Dad taught it to me. This site has been neglected for many years. A cleansing ceremony will help strengthen its connections to the Spirit World.,9,2,21
,"The group seats down in a meditative stance. Tenzin bends the smoke from an incense burner, encircling the group. As the smoke approaches the dragonfly bunny spirits, they fly off.",9,2,21
Bumi,"[Annoyed.] Good job, you cleansed the area of the only spirits that want to help us, and you scared away Bum-Ju.",9,2,21
,"Tenzin ignores his brother and continues bending the smoke. As he bends the third circle, the ground around rumbles.",9,2,21
Tenzin,It's working.,9,2,21
,The other members of the group look on in fear as the rumbling strengthens. The center of the circle suddenly opens and swarms of bat-like dark spirits fly out. The spirits fly out into the sky before swarming toward the group.,9,2,21
Bumi,Ah! Bats! Evil bats! [Everyone retreats to the rocks for cover.],9,2,21
Korra,Not bats. Dark spirits.,9,2,21
,"The dark spirits fly out and back into the circle. Korra and Tenzin attempt to bend at the spirits, but they manage to overwhelm their bending abilities and fly back to the circle, causing everyone to cower to the ground.",9,2,21
Tenzin,What are we supposed to do?,9,2,21
,"Korra follows the dark spirits and runs to the circle. She meditates before waterbending at them, trapping them in an enclosure. She purifies the spirits, causing them to glow gold.",9,2,21
Kya,[Shield her eyes from the glow.] Amazing.,9,2,21
,Cut to the outside of the circle where the purified spirits dissipate in a golden glow. The overgrowing vegetation on the circle eventually retreats and disappears.,9,2,21
Tenzin,Your spiritual training has come a long way.,9,2,21
Korra,"Unalaq may be a horrible person, but his spirit powers are no joke.",9,2,21
Tenzin,[Ashamed.] He taught you how to transform dark spirits. I can't even get you into the Spirit World.,9,2,21
Korra,Everything Unalaq taught me was to help himself. Everything you've done was meant to help me. I am so sorry for turning my back on you as my mentor. I need you now more than ever.,9,2,21
Tenzin,I won't let you down.,9,2,21
,"Korra walks up to her mentor and hugs him. Tenzin's family looks on with pride, while his sister is wiping off a tear.",9,2,21
Tenzin,"The ancient airbenders must have built this site. If we meditate here, we'll be able to enter the Spirit World.",9,2,21
Korra,Why don't you go first?,9,2,21
Tenzin,"After all these years, my father's dreams for me will finally come true.",9,2,21
,"Cut back to Republic City, outside Mako's apartment. Cut to the inside where Mako is looking through multiple documents when a knock on the door is heard. Mako opens the door to see Asami waiting.",9,2,21
Asami,Hi. [Walks in.],9,2,21
Mako,Did you come by to tell me how paranoid I am?,9,2,21
Asami,[Places hand on Mako's shoulders.] No. I just wanted to come by to make sure you're okay. You seemed so agitated earlier.,9,2,21
Mako,I'm fine.,9,2,21
Asami,Maybe you need a night off. Why don't we go get some dinner?,9,2,21
Mako,"No, thanks. I'm a little busy.",9,2,21
Asami,Too busy for Kwong's Cuisine? [Walks forward.] Remember? We had our first date there.,9,2,21
Mako,Maybe I do need to get my mind off things. [Kisses Asami.],9,2,21
Lu,"[Banging the door, voice-over.] Police! [Mako opens the door, revealing him to be with Chief Lin Beifong and Gang.] Hey, Mako. [Walks in.] Hope we didn't interrupt you two lovebirds.",9,2,21
Mako,What's going on?,9,2,21
Lu,We busted some Triple Threats who said you hired them for a job. [Gang opens a wardrobe.],9,2,21
Mako,"All right. [Sighs.] It's true. We were trying to figure out who stole Asami's stuff, so we hired them for a sting operation. I'm sorry for going behind your back. [Gang closes the wardrobe, while Lu opens a shelf.]",9,2,21
Lin,"According to the Triple Threats, you did more than that. They said you helped them steal a warehouse full of Future Industries property.",9,2,21
Asami,[Taken aback.] That's crazy! [Lu walks off.],9,2,21
Mako,[In disbelief.] You're gonna believe a bunch of criminals?,9,2,21
Lin,I have to follow up on a lead. [Gang opens a box.],9,2,21
Lu,"[Holding a bag.] Well, looky what I found: cash ... [Reaches in an pulls out explosives.] And these.",9,2,21
Lin,"What are you doing with explosives, Mako?",9,2,21
Mako,I don't know where those came from.,9,2,21
Gang,[Handcuffs Mako.] You're under arrest.,9,2,21
Mako,[Defensively.] None of that is mine.,9,2,21
Gang,"[Blankly.] Yeah. Should've known you'd hook up with your old pals. Once a Triple Threat, always a Triple Threat.",9,2,21
Asami,This has to be a mistake.,9,2,21
Lu,"Sorry to break the news to you, sweetie, but your boyfriend's just a crooked cop. That sting operation was just a way to lure you away from your warehouse.",9,2,21
Gang,[Chuckles.] He was using you the whole time. [Asami looks on in disbelief and confusion.],9,2,21
Mako,"That's not true, Asami. I would never do anything to hurt you. [Being escorted off.] It's Varrick. This is all Varrick. He set me up!",9,2,21
Gang,"Yeah, it's Varrick's fault. Varrick. [Chuckles.] Varrick.",9,2,21
,"Cut back to the Eastern Air Temple. Tenzin is meditating in the circle, while everyone is waiting around a bonfire.",9,2,21
Bumi,"[Pokes Tenzin with a long stick, causing him to twitch; impatiently.] You in the Spirit World yet?",9,2,21
Tenzin,"No, I am not, [Airbends the stick away; annoyed.] and stop bugging me. [Bumi folds his arms in annoyance.]",9,2,21
Kya,"It's okay, Tenzin. Maybe you weren't meant to guide Korra into the Spirit World.",9,2,21
Tenzin,[Obstinately.] No! Just give me some time.,9,2,21
Kya,[Irritated.] Stop being so stubborn. It's not your destiny. I think Jinora was meant to guide the Avatar.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Gets up and turns.] Jinora will not enter the Spirit World! She's not ready for the dangers of the other side, but I am. I've spent years training, studying, and mastering everything there is to know about the Spirit World.",9,2,21
Korra,"Tenzin, we're running out of time.",9,2,21
Tenzin,If everyone could just be quiet and let me [Turns.] focus. [Looks down to see his daughter.],9,2,21
Jinora,Aunt Kya is right. I can guide Korra into the Spirit World. I'll be all right.,9,2,21
Tenzin,"[Looks at his siblings, who give assuring looks.] Perhaps I will never have the connections with spirits like I always wanted ... like my father wanted me to have.",9,2,21
Jinora,"[Hugs her father.] It's okay, Daddy.",9,2,21
Tenzin,I'm proud of you. [To Korra.] Go. Close the portal. We'll wait here and keep your bodies safe till you return.,9,2,21
Korra,[Assuring.] We'll be all right.,9,2,21
,"Cut to Korra and Jinora meditating, while Bumi, Kya and Tenzin watch on. Cut to a close-up of Jinora, before cutting back to Korra, whose eyes glow. Cut to the two girls meditating. As Korra and Jinora overlap, the background changes from the meditation circle to the Spirit World.",9,2,21
Korra,[Amazed.] The Spirit World.,9,2,21
,Cut to Unalaq standing in front of Vaatu.,9,2,21
Unalaq,"The Avatar is dead, and we cannot open the Northern portal. I have failed you, Vaatu.",9,2,21
Vaatu,You have not failed me ... yet. The Avatar still lives.,9,2,21
Unalaq,How do you know?,9,2,21
Vaatu,"Even though my connection to Raava was severed, I can still feel her presence.",9,2,21
Unalaq,I'll find her.,9,2,21
Vaatu,The Avatar will find you. [Close-up.] She has just entered the Spirit World.,9,2,21
,Cut to credits.,9,2,21
Shiro Shinobi,"[Narrating a newsreel.] Korra and Jinora have entered the Spirit World. With Tenzin's daughter as her spiritual guide, the Avatar has one mission – to close the spirit portal before Harmonic Convergence. Meanwhile, Unalaq has been working with the dark spirit Vaatu, who was imprisoned by Avatar Wan ten thousand years ago. Will Korra be able to close the portal and stop Unalaq from enacting his deadly plan?",10,2,22
Shiro Shinobi,"[Narrating a newsreel.] Unalaq has forced Korra into opening the Northern portal and trapped Jinora in the Spirit World. Back in Republic City, everybody loves Varrick's Nuktuk movers.

Mako,What's up with the coat? And where did you get that pie?,12,2,24
Bolin,"It's a Varrick ship, you never know what you're gonna find. There's a whole level filled with fun-house mirrors. Of course, there's also the catgator deck. [Bolin briefly turns around showing his coat with a large hole in it.] I miss that guy, he really knew how to make a long trip interesting. So, have you told Korra yet about how [Cut to Korra bending.] you guys broke up, and you kinda started dating Asami while she was off getting attacked by dark spirits?",12,2,24
Mako,[Cut back to Mako and Bolin.] Will you keep it down? I'm waiting for the right moment.,12,2,24
Bolin,"Oh Mako, you know a wise man once told me that delivering bad news to a girlfriend was like ripping off a blood-sucking leech: you just have to do it fast and get it over with.",12,2,24
Mako,I hate it when you listen to me. Fine!,12,2,24
Tenzin,[Close-up.] Unalaq will be waiting for you. You'll need all of your Avatar power to stop him.,12,2,24

Tenzin,"Yes. I have read that long ago, the ancients would meditate beneath this tree and connect with the great cosmic energy of the universe.",14,2,26
,"The duo enters the hollow of the tree, and as Korra enters, various memories appear, ranging from her adventure regarding the Equalists to Wan's past.",14,2,26
Korra,These are my memories.,14,2,26
Tenzin,"The Tree of Time remembers all. Korra, the most powerful thing about you is not the spirit of Raava, but your own inner spirit. You have always been strong, unyielding, fearless. [Korra's memories fade off, with an image of Avatar Wan replacing them.]",14,2,26
Korra,Avatar Wan.,14,2,26
Tenzin,"Before he fused with Raava, Wan was just a regular person.",14,2,26
Korra,"But, he was brave, and ... smart, and always wanted to defend the helpless.",14,2,26
Tenzin,"[Memory shows Wan feeding multiple woodland animals, and him defending the spirits from firebenders.] That's right. He became a legend because of who he was, not what he was. He wasn't defined by Raava anymore than you are. [A memory of Unavaatu laying waste upon Republic City emerges.]",14,2,26
Korra,[Gasping while watching the memory.] Everyone in Republic City is in danger.,14,2,26
Tenzin,"You have to help them, Korra.",14,2,26
Korra,How? We're half-way around the world.,14,2,26
Tenzin,"[Putting his hand onto Korra's shoulder.] Do as the ancients once did. Connect to the cosmic energy of the universe. Don't bend the elements, but the energy within yourself.",14,2,26
Korra,You really think I can do this?,14,2,26
Tenzin,I have no doubt.,14,2,26
Korra,[Hugs Tenzin.] Thank you for not giving up on me.,14,2,26
Tenzin,I'm proud of you.,14,2,26
,"Tenzin walks out of the Tree of Time, but before he exits, he turns around to see Korra seated in a meditative position. He exits the tree, leaving Korra alone to meditate. As she meditates, a memory of Wan airbending alongside Raava emerges.",14,2,26
Wan,"If you and Vaatu have the same fight every ten thousand years, why hasn't one of you destroyed the other?",14,2,26
Raava,"He cannot destroy light, anymore than I can destroy darkness. One cannot exist without the other.",14,2,26
Unavaatu,Find the light in the dark.,14,2,26
,"The scene zooms in to Korra's face before fading through white, changing to a scene of Korra standing on astral lights. She opens her eyes and turns, seeing a large projection of herself, holding a ball of light. Korra looks on with determination and walks toward the ball of light. As she enters it, a large blue projection of herself exits her body and the Tree of Time. Cut to the outside of the tree, where everyone looks on in shock and surprise. Korra's projection reaches out to the overlapping portals and is sucked through, disappearing through the base of the portal.",14,2,26
Bumi,Uhhh ... what did you say to her exactly?,14,2,26
,"Cut to a frontal shot of Korra's projection as she speeds through the spirit lights. Cut to Republic City, its buildings surrounded with vines; an emergency alarm blares. The shot pans to the left, revealing Unavaatu standing in the bay, his arms stretched toward the water as he controls the vines that are overtaking the city. Cut to a frontal shot of him as he looks up. Switch to a back-shot of Unavaatu, showing a blue light coursing through the sky. The light intensifies into a bright ball. Cut to a side-shot of Unavaatu as the bright ball slams into him, knocking him back, ricocheting over the water's surface. Cut to a frontal shot of Korra's projection as she stands up. Cut to an overview shot of the bay, which is replaced by a frontal shot of Pema, Ikki, and Meelo looking on in surprise.",14,2,26
Ikki,Korra's back!,14,2,26
Meelo,And she's a blue giant!,14,2,26
,"Unavaatu rises up from the water and prepares to battle Korra. Both entities fire out their respective energy beams from their chests, but Korra focuses her beams to overpower Unavaatu's, eventually knocking him back. Korra runs forward, but Unavaatu shoots out tendrils toward her, which she catches and uses to immobilize and grab him before slamming him toward a nearby mountain. Korra leaps forward and holds Unavaatu's head with her right hand, while desperately searching for Raava within Vaatu.",14,2,26
Unavaatu,You're looking for something that is gone. [Ensnares Korra with his tendrils.] Raava has been destroyed. And soon you will be too!,14,2,26
,"Unavaatu fires a close range energy beam at Korra, knocking her unconscious. Cut to the Spirit World, where a swarm of dark spirits approach the Tree of Time.",14,2,26
Mako,They're coming for Korra!,14,2,26
,"Mako shoots out lightning toward the spirits. His attack is followed by Tenzin, Kya, and Bolin, who attack the spirits with their respective bending elements. Back at Republic City, Korra stumbles from the attack, but Unavaatu fires another energy beam at her, knocking her unconscious. Unavaatu bends out purple streams of water around her, preparing to corrupt her spirit. Back at the Spirit World, Team Avatar is forced to retreat to near the Tree of Time. Cut to Bolin who attacks the spirits with earthbending, but a spirit drags him away, though before it could attack, the entity was destroyed by a water stream. Cut to near the portal, where Desna and Eska attack the dark spirits.",14,2,26
Eska,Leave my Bolin alone!,14,2,26
Desna,I am so done with spirits.,14,2,26
Bolin,[Sliding toward Eska.] Eska! I love you! [Kisses Eska and bends a rock.] Let's face the end of the world together!,14,2,26
Eska,You're so romantic.,14,2,26
,"As the trio attack the spirits, the scene changes back to Republic City, where Unavaatu is near success in destroying Korra.",14,2,26
Unavaatu,"With you out of the way, I will be the one true Avatar.",14,2,26
,"A ball of light descends from the sky. Cut to Ikki's point of view, via a telescope, where she notices Jinora in the light.",14,2,26
Ikki,"Mommy, it's Jinora. She's ... beautiful.",14,2,26
Pema,"What? Let me see. [Takes the telescope, gasps in surprise; shouting.] Be careful sweetie!",14,2,26
,"Jinora descends toward Korra, holding with her a small ball of light. She opens her palms, releasing the light, which illuminates Republic City. Unavaatu, who is shielding his eyes from the glare of the light, stops bending, releasing Korra. As he recovers from the glare, a ball of light emerges from his chest.",14,2,26
Unavaatu,No!,14,2,26
Korra,Raava!,14,2,26
,"Korra runs forward and punches Unavaatu before reaching into his chest. As she touches the ball of light, she pulls out Raava. She subsequently prepares to purify Vaatu.",14,2,26
Unavaatu,No!,14,2,26
,"After purification, Unavaatu dissipates into the sky in a golden light. Korra bows in respect.",14,2,26
Korra,Go in peace.,14,2,26
Raava,Harmonic Convergence is nearly over. We must return to the Spirit World so we can fuse once again.,14,2,26
,"Raava and Jinora descend onto Korra's open palms, where she cups them with her hands for safety, before teleporting away. Cut back to the Tree of Time, where everyone was forced to retreat into the hollow. The spirits soon swarm the hollow, darkening the interior. Cut to a far shot of the spirit portals, where a beam of light descends from the center, illuminating the Tree of Time and dissipating the dark spirits. Cut to an aerial shot of the Tree of Time, where Korra's projection has returned. She opens her palms, releasing Raava and Jinora, who glides to her father.",14,2,26
Jinora,"I'll see you soon, Dad.",14,2,26
,"Tenzin reaches out for Jinora, but she disappears before he could do so. Korra's projection also dissipated and returns to her body. Cut to the healing hut, where Jinora awakens from her coma. She turns to smile at Asami and her grandmother. Katara approaches her and gave her a hug.",14,2,26
Jinora,"Gran-Gran, I missed you.",14,2,26
Asami,What about Korra and the others?,14,2,26
Jinora,"Don't worry, they're all right. Korra saved the world.",14,2,26
,"Tonraq and Senna hug each other in happiness. Cut back to the Spirit World where Korra walks out of the Tree of Time to find her allies and Raava waiting. Raava flies toward Korra, allowing her to hop and, and subsequently soars to the overlapping portals. Korra reaches out for the portal, which releases yellow bolts of energies from the overlapping portals. As Harmonic Convergence passes, the portals separate again. Cut to a shot of Earth where the spirit lights retreat. Cut back to the Spirit World where the portals now stand upright. Cut to Korra, who glows blue with a white imprint of Raava on her chest, before descending.",14,2,26
Tenzin,The Avatar Spirit has returned.,14,2,26
,"Korra descends back to the ground, using an air spout to slow her fall. She opens her eyes, which glow momentarily before fading.",14,2,26
Korra,It's over.,14,2,26
,"Mako, Bolin, and Tenzin run up to Korra. Mako hugs and kisses her.",14,2,26
Mako,I don't even know what to say.,14,2,26
Tenzin,You were amazing.,14,2,26
Bolin,"[Excitedly.] And the way you turned all gigantic like that, wow! I just wished Varrick was here to film it! It would be the greatest mover ever. After the Nuktuk chronicles of course.",14,2,26
Korra,[Walking to her cousins.] I'm sorry about your father. But he was already fused with Vaatu. I couldn't save him.,14,2,26
Eska,It seems cousin Korra is under the impression we're saddened by our father's demise.,14,2,26
Desna,"But I will not miss him at all. In the end, he became a deplorable man.",14,2,26
Eska,Agreed. But how will we explain this to mother?,14,2,26
Bolin,"So, I was thinking. I'm not really a fan of a long-distance relationship thing, [Korra walks off.] so how about you move to Republic City with me.",14,2,26
Eska,I do not think it will be possible.,14,2,26
Bolin,[Somewhat disappointed.] Okay. Desna can come too.,14,2,26
Eska,"I will not be joining you, Bolin. Desna and I must return home.",14,2,26
Bolin,But you said-,14,2,26
Eska,Eternal darkness was upon us. I became caught up in the moment.,14,2,26
Bolin,[Sadly.] Yeah. I guess I did too.,14,2,26
Eska,"[Walking toward Bolin.] But, you will always hold the special place in the organ that pumps my blood. I will remember you fondly. [Places her right hand to her heart, while smiling.] My turtle duck.",14,2,26

Bumi,"Bum-Ju, you're okay. [Hugs Bum-Ju.] I missed you, little buddy.",14,2,26
,Bum-Ju snuggles against Bumi. Cut to Tenzin and Korra who walk to the northern portal.,14,2,26
Tenzin,"Now that you're bonded with Raava once again, are you also reconnected with your past lives?",14,2,26
Korra,"[Sadly.] No. I think that link is gone, forever.",14,2,26
Tenzin,"I see. Why don't you close the portals, and we'll go home.",14,2,26
,"Korra walks up to the portal and stretches out her hand. As she reaches for the portal, she relaxes her palm.",14,2,26
Korra,Maybe I shouldn't.,14,2,26
Tenzin,What do you mean?,14,2,26
Korra,"[Bringing her palm back.] What if Unalaq was right when he said the Avatar shouldn't be a bridge between the two worlds? [Clenches her fist.] What if Avatar Wan made a mistake when he closed the portals? [Bum-Ju fetches a stick for Bumi, who in return strokes its head.] What if humans and spirits weren't meant to live apart? [To Tenzin.] Well, what do you think I should do?",14,2,26
Tenzin,"[Placing his hand on Korra's shoulder.] I think you should trust your instincts. There is nothing else I can teach you. You are the Avatar. Whatever your decision, I support you.",14,2,26
,Korra smiles and looks at the portal. Cut to the South Pole where Team Avatar exits the portal. Cut to the exterior of the palace where a large crowd has congregated. Cut to the interior where Mako approaches Korra.,14,2,26
Mako,"[Softly.] Hey, can we talk?",14,2,26
Korra,Of course.,14,2,26
Mako,"There's something I've been wanting to tell you about that fight we had. I know I said it wasn't that bad, but, that's not exactly true. I, um ... I-I broke up with you.",14,2,26
Korra,I remember.,14,2,26
Mako,"But, I thought you said you lost part of your memory.",14,2,26
Korra,"I did, but being inside the Tree of Time brought it back. I'm sorry for blowing up at you.",14,2,26
Mako,That's okay. [Holds Korra's hand.] I think we've both said things that we regret.,14,2,26
Korra,Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?,14,2,26
Mako,"I know I should have, but ... I didn't wanna hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the break-up too.",14,2,26
Korra,I think we both know that this. Us? Doesn't work.,14,2,26
Mako,You're right.,14,2,26
Korra,It's over. [Cut to a frontal shot of Mako's sad face.] For real this time. [Mako nods.],14,2,26
,"Switch to a side shot. Korra places her hand on Mako's cheek to guide him in for a soft kiss. As they break their kiss, they remain close together with their foreheads touching and their eyes closed. Korra sheds a tear, while standing there in a moment of silence. They open their eyes and stand erect once more.",14,2,26
Mako,"I'll always love you, Korra.",14,2,26
Korra,And I'll always love you. [Walks off.],14,2,26
Bolin,[Sliding toward Mako.] You want a hug?,14,2,26
,"Bolin awkwardly hugs his brother. Cut to the exterior of the palace where Korra is making a speech, with her parents and Avatar Aang's family standing behind her.",14,2,26
Korra,"The war of the Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent, [The crowd cheers.] and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief! [As Tonraq walks up to greet the audience, he is greeted with thunderous cheers.] I've realized that even though we should learn from those who came before us, we must also forge our own path. So that is why I've decided to keep the portals open. Humans can now physically enter the Spirit World, and spirits will be free to roam our world. I will no longer be the bridge. Humans and spirits must learn to live together. My mission will always be to use Raava's light spirit to guide the world toward peace and balance. Harmonic Convergence has caused a shift in the planet's energy. I can feel it. Things will never be the same again. We're entering a New Age.",14,2,26

Shiro Shinobi,"[Narrating a newsreel.] The world has entered a new age. Harmonic Convergence created an energy shift the likes of which has never been felt before. And after two weeks, Republic City continues to recover from Korra's epic battle with UnaVaatu. Vines have sprouted up all over, creating pockets of wilds the spirits have come to call home. What other changes are in store for our city?",1,3,27

Kya, Pema, Tenzin, Rohan, Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, Bolin, Bumi, and Korra all stand together, as the airship lands. The doors slide open and Asami is seen standing just inside the vehicle.",2,3,28
Asami,Did someone order a fully equipped Future Industries airship?,2,3,28
Korra,It's perfect! Thanks Asami.,2,3,28
Asami,"I figured if we're going to Ba Sing Se to search for airbenders, we should do it in style.",2,3,28

Mako,"Of course, Korra. [Suddenly self-conscious.] Avatar. Avatar Korra. [Stands up very straight, begins to speak in a very professional tone.] Once I received your message I proceeded to contact various locations within the Earth Kingdom as ordered by you, the Avatar.",2,3,28
Korra,"[Sarcastic.] Right, the Avatar thanks you for your loyal service. Did you find any more leads?",2,3,28
Mako,There are reports of airbenders popping up all over the Earth Kingdom. I marked the villages on this map. [Takes off the map slung over his shoulder.] You guys can take it with you.,2,3,28
Korra,"Actually, I was kind of hoping you could come, too.",2,3,28
Mako,"Really? Uh, it's probably better if I sit this one out.",2,3,28
Korra,"I know things have been weird between us since we broke up, but you're a part of Team Avatar, and we can't do this without you.",2,3,28
Mako,"I'm sorry, I can't.",2,3,28
Pema,"[Kisses Tenzin on the cheek.] I'll miss you, sweetie.",2,3,28

Mako,"[Turns to face Bolin.] Korra already asked, bro. I can't just leave Republic City. I have a life here, and a job.",2,3,28
Bolin,A life? You sleep under your desk. And what's a more important job than helping the Avatar rebuild an entire civilization?,2,3,28
Mako,It's not just that. [Turns away and faces the city.] I feel like I've been drifting apart from everyone.,2,3,28
Bolin,"Well, drift back, we need you! C'mon Mako, we're going to Ba Sing Se, where Dad grew up. What if I meet our grandma for the very first time, and she asks me [Imitating an old woman.] ""Where's your sweet brother?"" and I have to say ""I'm sorry, Grandma, he had some really important police paperwork to file"" and she starts to cry those grandma tears, and is like [Imitates his grandmother again and grabs Mako's shoulders.] ""Mako!

Cut to the interior of the airship, where the group sit around a table with the map in the center of them.",2,3,28
Mako,"As of now, these are the towns where we've gotten reports about airbenders. It looks like we can hit up most of them before we get to Ba Sing Se.",2,3,28

,"Cut to a large boat made entirely of wood in the middle of a seemingly endless ocean. Two White Lotus sentries stand in the two guard towers built to watch over the single wooden cage on the main deck.

,The White Lotus sentry in the speed boat looks up and shows his face.,2,3,28
White Lotus sentry,[Surprised.] Zaheer?!,2,3,28
,"Zaheer uses airbending to propel himself out of the speed boat over the White Lotus' firebending attack. He knocks the two sentries overboard with an airbending attack. As more sentries start coming out of the guard tower, Zaheer blasts two more overboard. A third sentry waterbends at Zaheer, who dodges out of the way and avoids a firebending blast as well. Ghazan tries to watch what is happening through the many wooden beams of his cage. Zaheer avoids another waterbending attack and jumps on top of Ghazan's cage. He jumps down and throws a handful of rocks into Ghazan's cage. Ghazan smiles. Zaheer knocks over another sentry and launches himself up onto the platform between the two guard towers. In his cage, Ghazan earthbends the rocks in a constant circle. He heats the rocks up to the point where they become lava and forms a five-pointed shuriken with it. Ghazan slices the wall of his prison using the lava and kicks a section of the wood out, knocking down one sentry. As Ghazan exits his prison, he knocks a sentry overboard. Zaheer and Ghazan clasp hands.",2,3,28
Zaheer,"It's nice to see you again, Ghazan.",2,3,28
Ghazan,Thanks for busting me out. Where did you pick up the new skills?,2,3,28
Zaheer,I have Harmonic Convergence to thank for that. I was given a gift. I believe it's a sign that our path is a righteous one.,2,3,28

Townsman,"Kuon and his family will be joining us shortly for a special dinner. Please, right this way. [Cut to the whole of Korra's party, the mayor, and Kuon's family seated down at a table filled with a spread of food.] Kuon has been the talk of the town ever since he's got airbending; he's like a local celebrity.",2,3,28
Tenzin,I just want to say it's an honor to meet a fellow airbender.,2,3,28
Kuon,"Oh, I still think of myself as a simple farmer. Who can airbend! [Airbends a pie into Bolin's face.] Oh, I'm so sorry! I still don't have any control.",2,3,28
Bolin,No worries! I love pie. And so does Pabu. [Pabu licks his face and drags the pie away.],2,3,28
Tenzin,"Well, you're so much more than just a farmer now. Harmonic Convergence changed everything. You represent the future of a culture that is being reborn. You're going to help us rebuild the Air Nation.",2,3,28
Kuon,I'm gonna do what now? The only thing I'm planning to rebuild is my barn.,2,3,28
Tenzin,But you must come with us to the Northern Air Temple.,2,3,28
Kuon,"Well, I can't do that. I have a family and a farm.",2,3,28
Tenzin,Of course you can come. This is of the utmost importance. Your wife will understand.,2,3,28
Kuon's wife,"Wait, what? No, I do not understand.",2,3,28
Kuon's daughter,"Daddy, where are you going? Why does the bald man want to take you away?",2,3,28
Kuon's wife,"No one's going to take Daddy away, sweetheart.",2,3,28
Korra,"Actually, this bald man does want to take him, but it's for an important cause. Your dad is an airbender, and he should learn about his culture.",2,3,28
Kuon,"I think there's been some sort of misunderstanding. I'm not going with you. I might be able to airbend, but I'm no Air Nomad, I'm no monk.",2,3,28
Townsman,"Okay, maybe we should just have some dessert huh? Who's up for dessert?",2,3,28
Tenzin,"Sir, you must understand, you're an airbender now, and there are thousands of years of culture you must learn about, skills you must master.",2,3,28
Kuon,"You expect me to abandon my entire life? My family? [Stands.] No! No sir, I'm not going anywhere with you and I think it's best that you leave.",2,3,28
,"Cut to the airship at night, followed by the interior where Team Avatar is having a meeting.",2,3,28
Korra,"In my head, I saw that playing out very differently.",2,3,28
Asami,Maybe we should have stayed and tried harder to convince him to join us.,2,3,28
Bolin,Or we could have thrown him in a potato sack and forced him into the ship.,2,3,28
Bumi,[Reading while on the couch.] That's how they got me to join the United Forces.,2,3,28
Tenzin,"No, we can't coerce people, or throw them in potato sacks. They must come freely. But not to worry, there are plenty of other airbenders out there who will be happy to come with us once they find out what the Air Nation is all about.",2,3,28
,"The next few shots are presented as a montage of Tenzin trying and failing to recruit the new airbenders: The airship is shown moving across a cartoon version of the world map to indicate the crew's journey, with all of the crew depicted as chibi heads of themselves. The chibis' faces start off looking happy but sport increasingly less happy expressions as Tenzin is repeatedly rejected.",2,3,28
Tenzin,"[The scene changes to the back view of a mother and her young son standing at an open door.] When your son becomes a master, he'll have tattoos all over his body, just like me. [Door slams. Addressing gourmand chewing on a drumstick.] There's nothing more nutritious than our vegetarian diet. [Door slams. Addressing a fashionista.] I can tell that you're going to love wearing our ancient airbender robes. They're very breathable. [Door slams. Addressing a fourth new airbender.] You'll never have to worry about your worldly possessions again, because you won't have any. [Door slams and only Tenzin's head can be seen through the diamond shaped glass panel on the door. The airbending master looks disappointed.

Tenzin,"Ugh, I really thought I had that last guy. Who doesn't want a bison as their best friend?",2,3,28
Bumi,"It's okay Tenzin, I still want to be an airbender.",2,3,28
Korra,"Okay, we've tried it your way, and people just don't seem to be responding. It's time for a little tough love.",2,3,28
,"Cut to the next household where Ryu's mother opens the door, revealing Korra, Bolin and Mako waiting outside.",2,3,28
Ryu's mother,"Oh, are you the Avatar? When my son got airbending, my husband and I were so happy. We thought this could open a lot of doors for him, maybe he could finally move out of the basement. [Chuckles.]",2,3,28
Korra,[Chuckles with the mother.] How old is he?,2,3,28
Ryu's mother,"He's twenty-two, and you know, still just to figuring his life out.",2,3,28
Korra,"Well, I have a great opportunity for him. We're looking for airbenders to join us at the Northern Air Temple.",2,3,28
Ryu's mother,"Ah, that sounds wonderful! I'll get him. [Authoritatively.] Ryu! Get up here!",2,3,28
,Team Avatar exchange thumbs up gestures with one another. Ryu enters the living room.,2,3,28
Korra,"[Outstretches a hand.] Hi, I'm Korra.",2,3,28
Ryu,So you're like the Avatar or something. Big deal.,2,3,28
Korra,"Uh, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity.",2,3,28
Ryu,"Yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested. [Walks back.]",2,3,28
Korra,"[Getting impatient.] Well, you're gonna be interested.",2,3,28
,"Korra grabs Ryu by the collar, airbends a chair out from under a table, and throws Ryu into it.",2,3,28
Korra,You're an airbender now and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.,2,3,28
Ryu,"Whatever. I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.",2,3,28
Korra,"[Scoffs.] Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.",2,3,28
Ryu,So? You don't have to.,2,3,28
Korra,"Yes, I do have to.",2,3,28
Ryu,"No, you don't.",2,3,28
Korra,"Yes, I do!",2,3,28
Ryu,"No, you don't.",2,3,28
Korra,"Well, [Sighs.] if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos. Think about that! Is that what you want?",2,3,28
Ryu,Maybe.,2,3,28
Korra,"No, it's not!",2,3,28
Ryu,So what? Who cares?,2,3,28
Korra,Everyone cares!,2,3,28
Ryu,I don't care.,2,3,28
Korra,"[Slams table.] Yes, you do!",2,3,28
Ryu,"No, I don't.",2,3,28
Korra,"Well, you're about to care, you little slacker, because you're coming with me! [Grabs Ryu by the collar and drags him out of the house.]",2,3,28
Ryu,"Stop pulling on my collar! You're stretching it out! Mom, are you just gonna let her take me?!",2,3,28
Ryu's mother,I think it's a great opportunity. Just try it for a week and see how it goes.,2,3,28
Ryu,No! Let me go!,2,3,28
,"Ryu releases a blast of airbending from his hands, propelling himself back into the house; Korra is left at the door, holding on to the two halves of his ripped jacket.",2,3,28
Korra,That's it!,2,3,28
,Korra tries to walk back into the house but Mako and Bolin each grab her by the arm and start to pull her away. Korra struggles.,2,3,28
Mako,"Korra, enough! Let's get out of here!",2,3,28
Bolin,So nice to meet you! Good luck with your son!,2,3,28
,"Ryu's mother shoves Ryu. Cut to a prison somewhere, littered with White Lotus sentries. Camera pans down to show several levels of catwalk around the inner edges of a large octagonal building. The structure is positioned above a vast pit of lava. A single cage suspended with wires rests in the center of the building, floating high above the bubbling lava below. The small cage is braced with metal bars and holds Ming-Hua, a woman with long, black hair and no arms.",2,3,28
White Lotus sentry #1,We're under attack!,2,3,28
White Lotus sentry #2,Look out!,2,3,28
,"Ming-Hua looks up in interest and sees a large blast of fire from one of the White Lotus. Two sentries are thrown off of their platforms with blasts of airbending. Up on the platform, Ghazan throws a barrel out over the cage. Zaheer, dressed as a White Lotus member, slices the barrel open with airbending and water gushes out. Ming-Hua spins and waterbends the falling water into a pair of tentacle-like arms, occupying the space where her nonexistent arms would normally be. She knocks open the door of her cage and begins to climb. She launches herself up to a platform and throws a White Lotus member off. Ming-Hua dodges a fire blast and propels herself to a higher platform using her ""arms"". She lands on the second-to-highest platform and freezes the end of her water arm into an angled piece of ice and uses it to hook the neck of a White Lotus and hurl him off of the platform. She simultaneously grabs another White Lotus member and slams him hard on the metal platform. Zaheer and Ghazan run up behind her.",2,3,28
Ming-Hua,I never thought I'd be so happy to see your ugly mugs again.,2,3,28
Ghazan,"Great to see you too, Ming-Hua.",2,3,28
Ming-Hua,[Turns to Zaheer.] I'm flattered. You busted me out before that girlfriend of yours.,2,3,28
Zaheer,We're getting her next.,2,3,28
,"Cut to a room with a large table surrounded by filled chairs. In the chairs are Korra, Tenzin, Bumi, Bolin, Asami, and Mako. All of them look very disheartened.",2,3,28
Tenzin,"[Dejectedly.] Well, I guess we should just go to Ba Sing Se and try our luck there.",2,3,28
Korra,I don't know what to do. I just thought more people would be excited about coming with us.,2,3,28
Bumi,"Well, maybe you gotta do more to get them excited. You need to add a little razzle-dazzle.",2,3,28
Bolin,"Yeah, razzle-dazzle! We could put on some sort of airbending street performance!",2,3,28
Bumi,"I was gonna say we could cover Tenzin's robe in sequins, but that's even better!",2,3,28
Korra,"It sounds ridiculous, but it might work.",2,3,28
Tenzin,I'm willing to try anything at this point.,2,3,28
Bolin,Yes! That is the kind of enthusiasm I like to hear!,2,3,28
,"Cut to the airship flying close over an Earth Kingdom town, made up of sandy-colored rock. A small crowd has gathered to watch the airship.",2,3,28
Bolin,"[Up on the airship speaking through a megaphone.] Come one, come all to witness The Amazing Airbenders! The airbending show that will leave you breathless ... with wind! First up, the tattooed master himself, you know him as the son of Avatar Aang, he shaves every hair on his head, every single day! [Tenzin takes his shirt off and turns to face the audience.] It's the one, the only guy with an arrow pointing to his nose, Tenzin!",2,3,28
,Tenzin airbends a large wheel and drives it around in front of the awed crowd. The crowd begins to cheer as Tenzin stops in the middle of the half-circle created by the audience and throws his hands up in the air.,2,3,28
Bolin,"Now, now, ladies and gentleman, ladies and gentleman, please be quiet. I have some serious news. We've heard that an escaped firebending convict has been spotted near here. [Crowd begins nervous murmuring.] Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf-",2,3,28
,"Cut to Mako standing in the crowd with his arms folded. At his cue, Mako straightens up and begins to walk out of the crowd.",2,3,28
Crowd member,I see him! He's right there!,2,3,28
Mako,"[Very stiffly.] I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.",2,3,28
,Mako pauses before letting out a small blast of fire from his fist into the air. The whole crowd gasps.,2,3,28
Bolin,[Crowd continues to mutter.] Oh no! Who will help us?,2,3,28
Korra,I will. With my airbending skills!,2,3,28
,"Korra catches Mako in an airbent tornado. She lets him go and he falls, but she catches him with another airbending blast and brings him up in another tornado.",2,3,28
Mako,"[No longer stiff, slightly panicking.] Ah! Hey! Let me go! This is not what we rehearsed! Korra!",2,3,28
,"Korra laughs and turns to Asami, who also starts to chuckle. Oogi soars through the air and does a barrel roll.",2,3,28
Bolin,"With the power of airbending, even this beast can float! [Whispered.] Like a feather. [Bumi begins to show off some air blasts.] Look what can be done in only a few short weeks of practice!",2,3,28
,Jinora flies over the crowd on her glider. The whole crowd frightfully gasps.,2,3,28
Bolin,"No no, don't worry folks. She might be young, but she is in full control!",2,3,28
,Jinora softly lands on the peak of a tall fountain. The entire crowd begins to cheer.,2,3,28
Bolin,"Ladies and gentlemen, if you, or anyone you know is an airbender, please, send them our way! Master Tenzin and Avatar Korra would love to teach them all they know!",2,3,28
,"Korra shrugs and smiles at Tenzin. The crowd begins to disperse. A young boy, Kai, runs up to the group.",2,3,28
Kai,"Hey! Hello. If you're looking for airbenders, you just found one.",2,3,28
,Kai proceeds to demonstrate his airbending abilities.,2,3,28
Kai,I wanna join you guys.,2,3,28
,The group becomes excited.,2,3,28
Bolin,Get outta town!,2,3,28
Korra,"We got our first recruit. [To Kai.] Just to be totally clear, we're going to be heading to Ba Sing Se, then the Northern Air Temple to live as nomads and rebuild the Air Nation. All that sound good to you?",2,3,28
Kai,"Yeah, Ba Sing Se, rebuild the temple, Air Nomad what-do-you-do, I'm in. Let's go right now.",2,3,28
Bolin,"[Bolin jumps in the air.] This is going to be so great! [To Kai.] You going to love it, er ... ah ... real quick, what's your name?",2,3,28
Kai,Kai. So when do we hit the road?,2,3,28
Tenzin,"Hang on a second Kai, where are your parents? We can't have you come with us without their permission.",2,3,28
Kai,[Looking down.] My parents are ... gone. [Korra looks at Tenzin.],2,3,28
Bolin,You're an orphan?,2,3,28
Kai,"It happened about a year ago. My home town was raided by outlaws, but my parents fought back against them. I was so scared, but they told me not to worry they would protect me, and they did. My parents saved me and the entire village, but they died in the fight. Mum and pap meant everything to me, they're were my whole life. [Bolin starts to shed some tears.] Ever since then, I've been on the run. Those same outlaws are still after me.",2,3,28
Bolin,"Well, you don't have to be on the run anymore, [Looks at the rest of the group.] right guys? Tell him.",2,3,28
Tenzin,I'm so sorry about your parents. I know we could never replace them ... [Puts his hand on Kai's shoulder.] but we are here for you.,2,3,28
Korra,"We'll keep you safe, come on.",2,3,28
Bolin,"[Wraps his arm around Kai's shoulder.] When you board this airship, you're going to leave your old life behind and start a new path. That's big brother advice. Just think of me as your big brother. [Kai smiles at Bolin.]",2,3,28
,"After everyone boards the airship, Mako stops and walks away from the group. He stares out a window and sees a group of motorcyclists in official-looking uniforms pulling to a stop outside their airship.",2,3,28
Mako,Guys! I think we got trouble.,2,3,28
,"The whole group turns around, the lead motorcyclist gets off his motorcycle and takes his helmet off. He walks up to the airship and takes his glasses off.",2,3,28
Earth Kingdom sheriff,"Release the boy, or we'll take him by force.",2,3,28
,The sheriff clenches his fist as his deputies each earthbend a rock from the ground and get into a fighting stance.,2,3,28
Kai,"The outlaws! They're here ... Uh, let's get out of here. [Grabs on to Korra's arm.]",2,3,28
Korra,[Korra looks down at Kai.] We are not running away from anyone.,2,3,28
,The airship door opens to reveal Korra standing at the top.,2,3,28
Korra,"[Addresses the deputies.] If you want Kai, you'll have to go through me!",2,3,28
,"The deputies launch their rocks at Korra, who jumps out of the airship's door and destroys the rocks with airbending, before rolling on the ground and airbending at the deputies, knocking them all over. The sheriff soon gets back up and earthbends at Korra, who dodges the attack and knocks down the sheriff with her own earthbending move.",2,3,28
Korra,Your days of harassing an innocent boy is over. You outlaws are going to prison.,2,3,28
Earth Kingdom sheriff,"Outlaws? Innocent boy? I'm a sheriff [He looks at his badge before looking up.] and these are my deputies, and this kid is a thief. [Korra opens her eyes wide in surprise.] Whatever he told you was a lie, we've been chasing him for months.",2,3,28
Korra,Where's Kai?,2,3,28
,"Korra turns around, failing to see Kai or Mako among the group. The camera pans to the left to reveal Mako walking toward her, holding Kai with one hand and a sack with the other.",2,3,28
Mako,"Right here, I found him slipping away.",2,3,28
Kai,I was just going to the bathroom.,2,3,28
Mako,With your stash of gold?,2,3,28
,"Mako throws the sack toward the sheriff. When it hits the ground, jewelry and gold spill out.",2,3,28
Kai,"I told you, I found this on the road.",2,3,28
Mako,Enough with the lies kid. I want the truth.,2,3,28
Earth Kingdom sheriff,"The truth is, he's the outlaw. He spent an entire life in an orphanage, got adopted by a real nice family six months ago, and how did he repay them? By taking their entire life savings. We've been after him ever since.",2,3,28
Korra,Is that true?,2,3,28
Kai,"The person who stole that stuff was the old me. Once I got airbending, I changed. I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like airbending choose me for a reason [Bolin looks sad.], like I'm a new person. I'm sorry! Please, you have to listen to me.",2,3,28
,"The sheriff and his deputies start to take him away, along with the sack of gold.",2,3,28
Bolin,"Are, are you taking him back to the orphanage?",2,3,28
Earth Kingdom sheriff,"No, he's headed to jail.",2,3,28
Korra,"Wait! You've got the family's life savings, now let us take Kai.",2,3,28
Tenzin,Do you really want our first member of the Air Nation to be a liar and a thief?,2,3,28
Korra,"He just needs some guidance, Tenzin. Who better to give it to him than us?",2,3,28
Earth Kingdom sheriff,Do you want this boy or not?,2,3,28
Tenzin,"[Strokes his beard and thinks for a while.] Yes, you can release the boy into our custody.",2,3,28
,The sheriff's deputies let go of the Kai's hands. He smiles and runs to hug Korra.,2,3,28
Kai,Thank you!,2,3,28
Korra,Don't make me regret it.,2,3,28
,Bolin and Jinora approach him; she smiles toward him and Bolin hugs Korra and Kai.,2,3,28
Bolin,"Welcome to the family, little bro.",2,3,28
,"Jinora hugs Bolin, Korra, and Kai. Bumi goes and hugs Tenzin, much to his annoyance. The sheriff and his deputies drive away from the scene. As the group goes back onto the airship, Mako stops Kai, turns his head around to better look at his face, and bends down.",2,3,28
Mako,"I just want you to know that I'm going to be watching you, kid. I know exactly what you're all about, 'cause I've been there. You don't have me fooled.",2,3,28
,"Mako stands up and moves back from Kai, who in turn backs away from Mako.",2,3,28
Kai,"Woah! Hey, lighten up. [Putting his hands in his pockets.] I'm turning over a new leaf, making a change. [Starts walking into the airship.] Don't you worry about me.",2,3,28
Jinora,"Hi, I'm Jinora. [Blushing, while Tenzin passes her by to enter the airship.] If you need any help with airbending, I could show you what I know.",2,3,28
Kai,"Thanks, that's real nice of you. [Smiles at Jinora.]",2,3,28
Tenzin,"[Jinora looks in surprise.] Jinora, we're leaving now. [Jinora walks into the airship and smiles at Kai.]",2,3,28
,"The scene zooms out and shows the whole Future Industries airship before shifting to Ming Hua's prison: a desert terrain, which has a fence and volcano nearby. The camera zooms into the prison and shows Ming Hua's empty cell, before going up to show a White Lotus sentry and an elderly Zuko standing on the higher tier of the prison.",2,3,28
White Lotus sentry,"They came out of nowhere. [He bows his head down.] I'm so sorry, Lord Zuko.",2,3,28
Zuko,How could you let this happen?,2,3,28
White Lotus sentry,"They caught us by surprise, and Zaheer is an airbender now.",2,3,28
Zuko,"[Alarmed by the revelation.] No! This can't be. [Looking at the White Lotus Sentry.] Do you have any idea the power these criminals possess? Individually, they can take down any bender. [Looks down in fear.] Put them all together, they could take down the entire world. And now you're telling me that their leader is an airbender?",2,3,28
White Lotus sentry,We can track them.,2,3,28
Zuko,"We don't need to track them, I know exactly where they're going. [As he and the White Lotus Sentry walk out of the prison, the shot fades to white.] Notify the new chiefs of the Northern Water Tribe that an attack on their prison is imminent, [The white fades out to reveal Druk, Zuko's dragon.] and send word to Lin Beifong in Republic City. The Avatar must be protected.",2,3,28
,Zuko's dragon lowers its neck and Zuko gets on it.,2,3,28
White Lotus sentry,Where are you going?,2,3,28
Zuko,[Mounting Druk.] To stop them.,2,3,28
,Druk roars and flies off into the distance.,2,3,28
,Cut to credits.,2,3,28
,"The scene opens to the Future Industries airship as it flies over the Earth Kingdom, with Oogi flying just above. Cut to the platform atop the airship, where Bumi and Kai are practicing their airbending, under the instruction of Jinora and watched by Asami, Naga, and Pabu.",3,3,29
Jinora,"Light on your feet, Uncle Bumi. Remember, you want to be quick and evasive.",3,3,29
Bumi,"[Moving around, his hands up like a boxer.] Don't worry about me, little lady. I've been in a scrap or two you know. Ha ha. [To Kai.] Oh, you're just a youngster, so I'm gonna go easy on ya. [As Kai runs toward him.] Wouldn't want to hurt a kid ...",3,3,29
,"Kai slides to the floor, and fires an airbending blast at Bumi's legs, knocking him to the ground.",3,3,29
Bumi,[Lying on the ground in pain.] Oh.,3,3,29
Jinora,"Uncle Bumi, you've got to work on your stance changes. [Jinora and Kai help Bumi to his feet.] Kai, that was just, really good.",3,3,29
Kai,"[Rubbing his head, as Bumi feels his jaw.] Thanks Jinora, you're a great teacher.",3,3,29
,"Jinora stares at Kai for a second, before turning away, blushing. She helps her uncle away, but he brushes her off, before patting his body, looking for something.",3,3,29
Bumi,"[Opening his coat.] Hmm, did I drop my wallet?",3,3,29
,"Jinora, looking behind Bumi, begins to chuckle as Kai strolls casually past them, fanning himself with Bumi's wallet. Bumi turns to look at the young boy.",3,3,29
Bumi,"[Running after Kai.] Give me that, you little thief!",3,3,29
,Shot pulls back to reveal Tenzin and Korra complacently watching the group on the platform below.,3,3,29
Korra,[To Tenzin.] It's so exciting to be on a diplomatic mission to Ba Sing Se. What's the Earth Queen like?,3,3,29
Tenzin,"I've never met her, but I've heard she can be quite ... demanding.",3,3,29
,"Bolin runs to accompany Korra and Tenzin, swinging his legs under the railings in excitement.",3,3,29
Bolin,"[Excitedly.] This is it, Mako! We made it! This is where Dad grew up! Come here! Look, look!",3,3,29
Mako,"[Joining his brother; rather more calmly.] Okay, calm down, I'm looking.",3,3,29
,The shot pulls back to show the airship approaching the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.,3,3,29
Korra,I wonder how many airbenders are down there.,3,3,29
,"Cut back to the airship approaching the wall. As it gets closer, the sun shines brightly over the top, before revealing the expansive city beyond. The airship finally manages to pass over the wall before the scene cuts to within the Lower Ring as a peasant sleeps against a building while the airship flies above. Cut to an overhead shot of the ring, smoke billowing from several buildings. Cut back to the airship, as Mako, Bolin, and Korra recoil from the smell, the two brothers holding their noses.",3,3,29
Korra,"Uhh, the Lower Ring looks terrible.",3,3,29
Bolin,"[Holding his nose.] Yeah, I can smell it from here. No wonder Dad left.",3,3,29
,"Cut to a side shot, as the airship continues to fly over the ring, before making it over the Inner Wall and into the Middle Ring.",3,3,29

,"Cut to another overhead shot of the airship, as it continues over the Middle Ring, before finally making it to the Royal Palace. Cut to Kai and Jinora, looking down in excitement.",3,3,29
Kai,Wow. Now this is more like it.,3,3,29
,"Cut to the Royal Palace, as the airship begins its descent, landing with a slight cloud of dust. Cut to the ramp as the party exits the airship, welcomed by a well-dressed Earth Kingdom man.",3,3,29
Gun,"[Bowing.] Avatar Korra, Master Tenzin, it is a pleasure to welcome you and your party to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se. I'm Grand Secretariat Gun.",3,3,29
Korra,"[Bowing herself, as Bolin strolls past with Pabu atop his shoulder, followed closely by Naga.] Thank you.",3,3,29
Bolin,"Aah, it's got that Upper Ring smell.",3,3,29
Gun,"[Turning to Bolin.] Oh no, the queen hates animals. [Cuts to a shot of Bolin, Pabu, Naga, and Oogi.] You'll have to get them out of sight.",3,3,29
Bolin,"[Scratching his head.] Well, I can just stash Pabu in my shirt, [Tilts his head at Naga and Oogi.] these two are going to be a little tougher.",3,3,29
Gun,"[Begins to walk away.] Come with me, hurry, I'll take you to your quarters.",3,3,29
,"Scene cuts to a pond, as the party walks over a bridge spanning the water.",3,3,29
Gun,"Now, when you meet the queen make sure you bow low enough, that's very important, and don't look her in the eye, she can't stand that. If any food is served, don't eat before she eats.

Korra,Seems like an awful lot of rules.,3,3,29
Gun,"[In exasperation.] Oh, you have no idea. And I'm the one who gets in trouble when people don't follow them, so please, please for my sake try not to upset Her Majesty.",3,3,29
,"Cut to Kai, who watches in interest as an Earth Kingdom citizen walks past, festooned with various items of jewelry. With a sly look on his face, he sidles away from the group to go after them. Cut to the party's temporary house.",3,3,29

Bolin,"[Impressed.] Ooh, very swanky.",3,3,29
,"Cut to the inside of the house, as the members of the group walk off to inspect the various rooms.",3,3,29
Gun,"Now, go in and make yourselves comfortable, [Turns to Bolin and Pabu; forcefully.] and keep those animals out of sight in the backyard.",3,3,29
,"Bolin and Pabu walk off in a huff. Gun begins to exit the house, and Korra follows him.",3,3,29
Gun,"Avatar Korra, if you'll follow me. We don't want to keep Her Majesty waiting.",3,3,29
,"The scene changes to an overhead shot of the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, before cutting to a side courtyard, where the Earth Queen is supervising an extensive renovation project.",3,3,29
Gun,"Your Majesty, may I present Avatar Korra.",3,3,29
,"Korra bows, but the queen, who has her back to them, does not pay them any attention.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"[To the workers below.] You're ruining the koi pond! It's completely overshadowed by the topiaries! Guards, take that buffoon away and get me someone who knows what they're doing!",3,3,29
,"Two Dai Li agents grab the offending worker, and escort him away.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"[To the worker's partner.] You, rip everything out and start over!",3,3,29
,"The young lady earthbends the ground beneath the topiaries and turns it over, leaving fresh ground in its place.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"I am surrounded by idiots. [She turns to acknowledge Korra.] So, I finally get a visit from the Avatar. Let me guess, you want something.",3,3,29
Korra,"Well, actually Your Majesty, I was hoping you could ...",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,[Cutting Korra off.] I hardly think you're in a position to ask me for favors after everything the last Avatar did to the Earth Kingdom. [She turns away from Korra.] He and Fire Lord Zuko took advantage of my father's weakness and stole our lands to make their own little empire. [She looks at Korra angrily.] The United Republic is Earth Kingdom territory!,3,3,29
Korra,"[Uncertainly.] Well, I uh, I'm not sure what I can do about that.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"Not that you care, but what's left of my kingdom is falling to ruin. Roving bands of barbarians are raiding villages in the countryside. And now, some of my subjects are refusing to pay their taxes. [She turns back to face the courtyard.]",3,3,29
Korra,"I'm very sorry for your troubles, but actually ...",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,[Shouting down into the courtyard.] That topiary is supposed to be an eel swan [Cut to Gun as he lowers in head in fear of the queen.] not a turtle duck!,3,3,29
,"The scene cuts back to Team Avatar's new house, with Mako, Asami, Jinora, and Tenzin congregated around a table.",3,3,29

Tenzin,[Standing up.] Kai?,3,3,29
Bolin,"[Coming down the stairs; shouting.] Kai, little bro.",3,3,29
Bumi,[Bursting through a side door.] He's not over here.,3,3,29
Asami,I don't think I've seen him since we landed.,3,3,29
Mako,I knew that kid was no good. He was just waiting for an opportunity to run away again.,3,3,29
Jinora,We have to find him.,3,3,29
Mako,What's the point? He obviously doesn't care about us.,3,3,29
Bolin,"But he's my new little brother. He's probably lost, and scared.",3,3,29
Tenzin,"He is just a little boy, and he's our responsibility. Besides, he's the only airbender we've recruited so far, we can't lose him.",3,3,29

Korra,"I don't really have servants. But, Your Majesty, the reason for our visit is that we're trying to gather all of the new airbenders who are popping up in the Earth Kingdom, and we'd like your help finding the ones in Ba Sing Se.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,[Skeptically.] Airbenders in Ba Sing Se. Where did you hear that?,3,3,29
Korra,Before we left Republic City we got some reports.,3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"Hmm. Well, before I even consider helping you, I'll need you to do something for me.",3,3,29
Korra,"Oh, of course. What is it?",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,I have a vault full of tax money sitting in a town south of here. Barbarians have stolen my past two shipments. Go collect my money and bring it back here.,3,3,29

Kai,"Here, sir, let me help you.",3,3,29
Upper-class man,"Oh, thank you, young man. What a strange sudden breeze. [Kai goes around the man, fixing his robe, while looking for anything precious.]",3,3,29

,"The scene shifts to a monorail station in Ba Sing Se. Kai runs up the stairs to get away from Mako. Kai gets into one part of the monorail while Mako gets into another. As Kai brisked across the monorail, he bumps into Mako and hesitates.",3,3,29
Mako,What are you doing running around robbing people?,3,3,29
Kai,I was just practicing my airbending. [Kai pulls a large grin.],3,3,29
Mako,Yeah right. Let's go. [Mako grabs Kai's top.] You're in big trouble.,3,3,29
,Kai slides out of his top only to leave it in Mako's hand and airbends the two brothers to the other side of the train. Everyone sitting in the monorail looks stunned. Kai runs out of the monorail. Mako and Bolin run to get off but the door closes.,3,3,29
Mako,Hey! [Mako bangs his hands on the side window.],3,3,29
,Kai smiles and waves at Mako and Bolin as the train leaves the station.,3,3,29
Mako,"[Angrily.] Your little brother, huh?",3,3,29
Bolin,"Yeah ... just a lovable little scamp, isn't he?",3,3,29
Mako,[Mako looks out the window.] Reminds me of my little brother.,3,3,29
Train conductor,"Designated express line to the lower ring. Next up, Poh Kong Station.",3,3,29
,"Scene shifts to monorail exiting the Upper Ring wall. Train track sounds created by monorail. Camera shows the side appearance of monorail going through the Upper Ring wall. The monorail arrives at Poh Kong Station, making a hard brake. After the monorail stops, everyone pushed Mako and Bolin out of the monorail.",3,3,29

,"Mako glares at Bolin with a blank stare and Bolin releases his hold on Mako, looking a little dejected. The scene changes to Future Industries airship leaving the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace. The screen shows Asami piloting the airship.",3,3,29
Asami,Are you sure we shouldn't have brought more people to collect the tax money?,3,3,29
Korra,There are royal guards waiting at the vault. [Korra turns around and looks at Asami.] I doubt anything will happen. I think Her Majesty likes ordering me around.,3,3,29

Bolin,"Ohh man, aww I slipped a disc sleeping here. It's been awhile since we spent the night in a trash pile. It's about how I remembered.",3,3,29
Mako,I bet everyone's freaking out that we've been gone all night. [Mako brushes off a banana on his head.],3,3,29

Bolin looks at Mako.] Haah, we might have to hustle up a little breakfast with the old, [Gestures his hand out to the fruits.] fruit stand scam. Come on. [Bolin grabs a reluctant Mako by the arm and drags him to the fruit stand, where flies surround the fruit. Bolin wraps his arm around Mako.] You remember how it goes, [Does a shoving motion.] I push you into the stand, [Raises his voice a bit.] you scream. [Places a hand on his head dramatically.] I pretend to faint.",3,3,29
Mako,"I don't want any part of it. Besides, look at this fruit, [Cut to the bruised, moldy fruit with flies buzzing around it.] it's disgusting. We don't want to steal this.",3,3,29
Tu,"[Rises into sight from under the stand.] Hey, [Points to Mako.] you trying to steal my fruit?",3,3,29
Mako,"No, I just said I don't want any of this rotten fruit.",3,3,29

Mako,So you want me to steal it?,3,3,29
Tu,"[Tu shows his fist to Mako and Bolin.] Just try me, buddy. [Kisses his bicep.] Go ahead.",3,3,29

Mako,How do you know our names?,3,3,29
Bolin,"Yeah, I mean I'm famous so I get that, but how do you know his name?",3,3,29

Bolin,"Yeah, they're not really comedies, but uh ...",3,3,29
Tu,"Yeah, I could probably be a pro-bender or an actor or something if I lived in a mansion in Republic City like you guys. You don't know what it's like on the streets. You got to be tough. [Flexes.]",3,3,29
Bolin,"Oh, Mako and I grew up on the streets. We were homeless, then we were kinda in a gang, then we lived in a gym ... [Chow drags Mako and Bolin into their home.]",3,3,29

,Royal Earth Kingdom guard opens the door.,3,3,29
Royal Earth Kingdom guard,You here to pick up the tax shipment?,3,3,29
Korra,Go ahead and load it on the airship.,3,3,29
,"Scene shows four Royal Earth Kingdom guards bringing the tax money into the airship. Suddenly, a red light appears in the sky. The Royal Earth Kingdom guards look up in surprise, so does Korra and Asami. Four motorcycles jump up a ramp, two motorcycles accompanied the truck to the airship. Royal Earth Kingdom guards run away in fear, dropping one sack of gold.",3,3,29
Asami,So much for our escorts.,3,3,29
Korra,[All the motorcycles and the truck heads toward Korra and Asami.] Maybe we should have brought everybody else.,3,3,29

Gombo,"Aww, we love gals with spirit, suit yourself.",3,3,29
,"Gombo attacks Korra, but she evades all attacks and earthbends him to her left. She subsequently earthbends two motorcyclists, throwing them up in the air. Other motorcyclists try to retreat but Korra earthbends all the motorcycles. One motorcycle charges toward Asami, but she charges back and takes them down. Another motorcyclist charged toward Asami, but Korra earthbends them away from her. Another motorcyclist picks up one of the sack of gold with his spear, but Korra airbends them off their motorcycle. Asami charges to one of the motorcycle. The motorcyclist attempts to attack her with his spear, however, she evades with the backflip and stunned both people on the motorcycle. Gombo gets back up and attacks Korra with several kicks, but Korra earthbends him again. The barbarian leader runs away from Korra.",3,3,29
Gombo,"Retreat, retreat! [The barbarians drive away from the airship.] You're on the wrong side of this fight, Avatar. That gold belongs to the people, not the Queen.",3,3,29

Zuko glances back at Tonraq and turns to him.] Didn't work.",3,3,29
Eska,[After another short silence.] Don't feel bad. I tried to kill Korra [Tonraq glances over his shoulder at his niece.] after she ruined my wedding. It happens.,3,3,29
Tonraq,[Turns to the others.] Let's just focus on keeping this woman in prison.,3,3,29
,"When the door of the lift opens, basking the foursome in light, Tonraq is the first to walk out. An overview shot reveals the foursome exiting the elevator and as the scene slowly pans up, a deep chasm comes into view with a prison, guarded by two White Lotus members, on the other side. Cut to another overview shot as the foursome stands at the front of an expandable metal bridge that is slowly being extended to the other side.",3,3,29
Zuko,The intense cold prevents her from firebending.,3,3,29
Desna,[Cut to a frontal shot of the foursome. Desna glances around and clouds form at his mouth as he speaks.] There's certainly no way anyone's breaking out of here.,3,3,29
Zuko,That's what we thought about the other three prisons.,3,3,29
P'Li,[P'Li shivering.] There must be something exciting going on [Retractable bridge stops extending.]. No one interesting has visited me in thirteen years.,3,3,29

Mako,So why did Dad leave Ba Sing Se?,3,3,29
Chow,"Oh, he always had big dreams. He couldn't wait to get out and see the world. Your grandfather thought it was ridiculous. He wanted San to stay home and work the fruit stand. But San was determined to leave, and they had a huge fight. [Yin looks sad and turns away.] And that was the last time they ever spoke. [Notices Yin's expression.] Oh, um ... sorry, Mom.",3,3,29

,"Scene cuts to outside of the building. Through the window Yin, Mako, and Bolin can be seen seated on a sofa.",3,3,29
Yin,"[As she speaks, the scene shifts into the room.] This is the only letter we ever got from San. It says he married a beautiful girl from the Fire Nation, and had two wonderful sons. He sent this picture of you all on his birthday. [Holds up picture of Mako and Bolin with their parents.]",3,3,29
Bolin,"Look, Mako! Dad's wearing your scarf!",3,3,29
Yin,"I'm so sad that I never got to meet your mother, [Speaking to Mako.] but you have her eyes. I know from looking at you two that she must have been a wonderful bride for my boy. [As she is speaking, Bolin sniffs and wipes away tears.]",3,3,29

Gun,It's being done as we speak.,3,3,29
Korra,"So now, Your Majesty, if I could start meeting some of the airbenders here in the city.",3,3,29
Hou-Ting,"The Dai Li thoroughly searched the city, but it seems your reports were incorrect. There are no airbenders in Ba Sing Se. So, you can gather your little band and be on your way tomorrow.",3,3,29
Korra,You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!,3,3,29
Hou-Ting,[To Gun.] Get her out of my sight!,3,3,29
,"Korra and Gun start to walk away, but Korra turns back and points at the Earth Queen, inadvertently knocking Gun down.",3,3,29

Chow,"[To Mako and Bolin.] You know, San would've been so proud of you guys! Traveling the world with the Avatar? He would've loved that!",3,3,29
Mako,We actually need to get back to the Avatar in the Upper Ring. We're supposed to be helping her find airbenders in Ba Sing Se. [Everybody gasps.],3,3,29
Bolin,[Quickly looks around.] What? What happened?,3,3,29
Chow,"One of our neighbors started airbending about a week ago. A couple days later, two Dai Li agents come out of nowhere and snatch him up. No one's seen him since.",3,3,29
Tu,"They say the Earth Queen's locking all the airbenders up somewhere, and using them for experiments.",3,3,29
Yin,Tu! Don't talk like that about Her Majesty! [She blows a kiss and bows to a portrait of Hou-Ting on the wall.] Long may she reign.,3,3,29
Mako,[To Bolin.] We have to get back to the Upper Ring and tell Korra. [They get up from the table and start to leave.],3,3,29

,"Kai turns a corner and walks down a dark alley, holding a bag of gold, with a sly smile on his face. His eyes widen, as he sees a Dai Li agent standing at the end of the alley. Cut to shot of nervous-looking Kai with beads of sweat on his forehead, as he turn back around and sees another Dai Li agent blocking the path back. Runs to the right and out of view, as both Dai agents fire rock gloves to stop Kai from climbing over a door and escaping, trapping him.",3,3,29
Kai,Hey! What's going on? [The bag of gold falls to the ground.] I didn't do anything! I'm with the Avatar.,3,3,29

Tonraq,Did you see Zaheer?,4,3,30
Zuko,The only thing I saw was a snowstorm heading our way.,4,3,30
Tonraq,"[Stares at the snowstorm ahead.] That's not a snowstorm, it's him!",4,3,30
,"Tonraq and the group begins running toward the snowstorm Zaheer created to cover his snowcat. Zaheer continuously airbends to provide his group with some cover. The snowcat jumps out and Zaheer and Ming-Hua jumps off the snowcat afterward, running toward Tonraq's group.",4,3,30
Tonraq,"I put you away once, Zaheer, and I'm going to do it again!",4,3,30
,"Tonraq waterbends a punch and an ice block at Zaheer, who dodges both attacks. Tonraq attacks Zaheer again, and he manages to dodge it again before sweeping Tonraq over. Desna and Eska begin attacking Ming-Hua with multiple ice shards at a rapid pace, which Ming-Hua dodges. The twins create a field of iceberg spikes, but Ming-Hua maneuvers through them with her water arms before she freezes the pair in ice blocks. She jumps up and breaks the ice on the ground with her waterbending before she glides down to P'Li's cell. A White Lotus sentry firebends at her, but she counters back, defeating him with little trouble. Another sentry attempts to waterbend at Ming-Hua, but she quickly strikes him. She freezes P'Li's prison cell's door, causing it to fall off of its hinges.",4,3,30

The scene shifts to Lord Zuko dodging a rock from Ghazan and retaliating with his firebending, before dodging again for another strike. Ghazan deflects Lord Zuko's blast before using a rock to strike Lord Zuko down. Tonraq tries to attack Zaheer, but the airbender continues dodging the blows.

Mako,[Takes the passports.] Thanks. I know this wasn't easy.,4,3,30
Yin,It's such a shame you two must leave so soon.,4,3,30

,"Korra rises with airbending and attacks Asami with an air kick, knocking off one of her protective gloves.",4,3,30

Asami,Can you interpret that?,4,3,30
Mako,The Earth Queen's been secretly taking away airbenders and forcing them into her army.,4,3,30
Korra,"[Angrily.] She was lying. I knew it! I swear, the next time I see her-",4,3,30

Korra,[Sarcastically.] Thank you! That is just the most wonderful news. Ever. Yay.,4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"So, I assume you and your [Pabu wiggles in Bolin's shirt.] friends here will be leaving immediately. [Sneezes repeated with unease. To Gun, struggling to breathe.] Is there an animal in my presence?",4,3,30
Gun,"N-no, Your Majesty. I would never allow an animal near you. [Bolin folds his arms innocently. Pabu's tail pops out of his shirt. Shocked, Bolin clasps his arms around the tail and runs off.]",4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"[Sneezes.] If I find one within fifty feet of me, it's your head. [To Team Avatar.] Anyway, if you need any assistance packing, let Gun know. He'll see to it that you're on your way by evening.",4,3,30
Korra,"Uhh, this evening? I'm not sure about leaving so soon-",4,3,30
Asami,Because our airship is having engine trouble. It'll take me until tomorrow to finish the repairs.,4,3,30
,"Hou-Ting continues sneezing. Gun walks off, and the Queen follows, sneezing onto his sleeve.",4,3,30
Korra,Thanks for buying us some time.,4,3,30
,Cut to the interior of Team Avatar's residence where everyone is having a meeting.,4,3,30
Tenzin,I can't believe the Earth Queen is conscripting airbenders.,4,3,30
Korra,Those people should not be forced to join an army!,4,3,30
Bumi,"Well, technically, the Earth Queen has a right to conscript her citizens. [Everyone stares at Bumi silently.] What? It's true.",4,3,30
Jinora,"[Worried.] Guys, what if Kai was spotted airbending? He might have been taken too.",4,3,30
Bolin,"Probably not. He's surprisingly difficult to catch, like a— like a little, greased hog-monkey.",4,3,30
Jinora,"But, what if he was?",4,3,30
Korra,"Don't worry, Jinora. We'll find him. We just need to figure out where to look.",4,3,30
Mako,I bet they're under Lake Laogai. [Everyone stares at him.] What? I've been reading some of Jinora's books. The old Dai Li agents used to have a secret fortress beneath the lake.,4,3,30
Jinora,"Mako's right! It's the perfect spot to hide airbenders, and I know how to check it out without being caught. I can project my spirit into it!",4,3,30
Bumi,"You mean that out-of-body thing you did to help giant, spirity Korra?",4,3,30
Tenzin,You can still do that?!,4,3,30
Jinora,"It's not as powerful as it was during Harmonic Convergence, but if I can get close enough, I think I can do it.",4,3,30
Korra,Let's go get Kai out. Let's get all the airbenders out.,4,3,30
,"Cut to the Dai Li fortress, where the airbenders are standing in pairs, one on either side.",4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,You are the property of the Earth Kingdom. [Kai glares at him.] You will become the Earth Queen's elite fighting force and protect her at all cost. It is your duty to serve the Earth Queen.,4,3,30
,"Two airbenders attack their opponents, cut to the other side, where they redirect the attacks and counter, knocking them off. Kai redirects his opponents blast and prepares to attack fiercely.",4,3,30
Yung,Go easy on me! I'm not that good.,4,3,30
,"Kai throws out a weak blast, which Yung easily dodges. Both smile at each other.",4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,"[Sternly.] Never show mercy! Now attack your opponent, and this time, like you mean it!",4,3,30
,"Kai throws a strong blast, easily knocking Yung out.",4,3,30
Kai,[To Yung.] Sorry.,4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,A soldier never apologizes to his enemy!,4,3,30
Kai,I'm not a soldier!,4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,You will be when I'm through with you.,4,3,30
,"Cut to Oogi approaching Lake Laogai, then to an island in the middle of the lake, where Jinora is in a meditative stance.",4,3,30
Tenzin,"If anything goes wrong, come back immediately.",4,3,30
Jinora,I will.,4,3,30
,"As Tenzin walks off, Jinora prepares to meditate. Pan to the underground fortress, which is flooded, where Jinora's ghostly spirit appears. She fades off and scans two more areas, before returning to her body.",4,3,30
Korra,What happened? What did you see?,4,3,30
Jinora,The airbenders aren't there! It's completely deserted.,4,3,30
Tenzin,They're not down there?!,4,3,30
Korra,"Jinora, you've read all about Ba Sing Se. Can you think of any other places the airbenders might be?",4,3,30
Jinora,"I guess they could be in the catacombs beneath the Upper Ring, or the ancient sewers beneath the Lower Ring, or the maze of tunnels that connect the rings together, or they could be—",4,3,30
Tenzin,[Sighs.] There are just too many places. There has to be another way to locate them.,4,3,30
Korra,Maybe there is. [To Jinora.] How did you find me during Harmonic Convergence?,4,3,30
Jinora,I don't know. I just kind of focused on your energy. I think our spiritual connection led me to you.,4,3,30
Korra,Maybe you can find Kai the same way. I know you two have a connection.,4,3,30
Tenzin,"[Concerned.] What do you mean ""a connection""?",4,3,30
Jinora,I don't know. Let me try.,4,3,30
,"Jinora returns to meditating. Cut to the fortress, where the Dai Li sergeant bends multiple earth discs to the airbenders, who attempt to block it with airbending. Only Kai was able to block the attack. The sergeant bends out more earth discs, and Kai blocks the attack meant for Yung.",4,3,30
Yung,Thanks.,4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,"You again?! If you have time to help your friend, then you're not getting enough rocks for yourself!",4,3,30
,"The sergeant attacks Kai with multiple discs. Kai managed to deflect the first two, dodge the next two, but was subsequently struck by the fifth and knocked down.",4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,I guess you're not as good as you thought.,4,3,30
,"Kai attempts to attack the sergeant with an air blast, which he easily dodges. The sergeant immobilizes him in an earth shell.",4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,Throw him in the hole!,4,3,30
,"Two Dai Li agents grab Kai and throw him into a prison cell. Kai looks away sadly before Jinora's ghostly spirit appears, shocking him.",4,3,30
Kai,Jinora?,4,3,30
Jinora,It worked!,4,3,30
Kai,How are you here right now?,4,3,30
Jinora,"Shh, quiet. It's a high-level airbender move. With a little spiritual stuff thrown in.",4,3,30
Kai,"[Breathes a sigh of relief.] At first, for a second there, I thought you were a ghost.",4,3,30
Jinora,[Chuckles.] It's good to see you. We've been looking for you and the other airbenders. We're going to get you all out of here. Where are we anyway?,4,3,30
Kai,"Underground somewhere. Other than that, I don't have a clue.",4,3,30
Jinora,I'll figure it out. Don't worry.,4,3,30
Kai,Jinora! [He pauses.] Thanks.,4,3,30
,"Jinora smiles and travels upward. Pan to the surface, where she looks back to see the temple.",4,3,30
Jinora,The Earth Queen's Temple!,4,3,30
,Cut to Team Avatar's residence.,4,3,30
Korra,I can't believe Miss Queeny Smug Face had them right under our noses the whole time!,4,3,30
Tenzin,We have to get into that compound tonight and get those airbenders out.,4,3,30
Bumi,"All right. We go in under the cover of darkness: two small insertion teams and a third on the outside. Then all we'll need is twelve tons of blasting jelly, a medium-sized bulldozer and ... does anyone have a badgermole that knows Morse code?",4,3,30
Tenzin,[Sighs.],4,3,30
,There is a knock at the door.,4,3,30
Asami,"[Irritated.] Oh great, not the Queen again.",4,3,30
Korra,"Everyone, act natural. And Bolin -",4,3,30
Bolin,"I'm on it! [Opens his outer shirt. Pabu chitters in protest.] What? Hey, I'm not sweaty this time! [Points at shirt. Pabu jumps in, and wiggles around.]",4,3,30
,Tenzin glances at others and opens the door. Lin walks in.,4,3,30
Tenzin,[Surprised.] Lin? What are you doing here?,4,3,30
Lin,We need to get Korra out of here immediately. Her life's in danger.,4,3,30
Korra,What?! [Moves toward Tenzin and Lin.] What's going on?,4,3,30
Lin,I just got word from Lord Zuko and Tonraq.,4,3,30
Korra,Why is Lord Zuko with my dad?,4,3,30
Lin,Zaheer and the others have escaped.,4,3,30
Tenzin,How is that possible?,4,3,30
Lin,Because Zaheer is an airbender now.,4,3,30
Tenzin,No ...,4,3,30
Korra,"[Impatient and exasperated.] All right, hold on! Will you quit ignoring me and tell me what's going on? Who's Zaheer? Why is my life in danger?",4,3,30
Tenzin,"[Exchanges glances with Lin and approaches Korra.] Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka and I were there to stop them. We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.",4,3,30
Korra,So that's why you and my dad sheltered me away.,4,3,30
Tenzin,It was for your own safety.,4,3,30
Mako,[Steps forward.] Why were they trying to kidnap Korra?,4,3,30
Lin,"We spent thirteen years interrogating them, but they never broke. To this day, no one knows what their motive was. [To Korra.] Now we need to get you back to Republic City, where I can protect you.",4,3,30
Korra,No ... I'm not running.,4,3,30
Lin,"Korra, you don't understand. These criminals are like nothing you've ever faced before.",4,3,30
Korra,"[Determined.] Look, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to protect me. I came here for one thing: to find airbenders. And I'm not leaving without them.",4,3,30
Lin,Fine. Let's get them and get out of here. Where are they?,4,3,30
Korra,"In a military compound, and we're busting them out.",4,3,30
,"Cut to the temple at night, where two royal guards are on patrol when they run into Jinora.",4,3,30
Jinora,Hi.,4,3,30
Guard #1,Hey! What are you doing here?,4,3,30
Guard #2,"Oh, it's just that little airbender girl who came with the Avatar. You shouldn't be walking around here all alone.",4,3,30
Jinora,"[Points to behind the guards.] I'm not alone. [Camera cuts out to show Korra, Bolin, Bumi, Tenzin, and Mako in their fighting stances. The guards get knocked out and tied up.]",4,3,30
,Cut to the interior of the temple where Team Avatar enter. They enter a doorway to hide from patrolling Dai Li agents.,4,3,30
Tenzin,"Bumi and Korra, come with me to find the airbenders. [To Bolin, Jinora, and Mako.] You three, find Kai. We'll meet on the surface shortly. Radio us if anything goes wrong.",4,3,30
,"Team Avatar head their separate ways. Cut to the prison cell, where Korra opens the door, awakening the airbenders.",4,3,30
Yung,What's going on? Who are you?,4,3,30
Korra,"I'm the Avatar, and I'm getting you all out of here. [The airbenders start murmuring.]",4,3,30
Tenzin,"Everyone, please! You must stay calm and quiet if we want this to work.",4,3,30
Yung,What to work? [His eyes widen.] We're sneaking out?,4,3,30
Korra,"Yes, and we must leave now.",4,3,30
Tenzin,We're going to get you away from the Earth Queen and out of the city. [Everyone begins to run out of the prison. Yung stops to talk to Tenzin and Korra outside of its entrance.],4,3,30
Yung,There's an airbender that's not here. His name is Kai. We need to get him.,4,3,30
Tenzin,We're already taking care of it.,4,3,30
Bumi,"[Crouching down low and speaking into a walkie-talkie.] Topside, this is Papa Bear. The breezies are in the hold; cue the balloons!",4,3,30
Lin,[In an airship.] What? Are you in trouble?,4,3,30
Bumi,No! We've got the airbenders and we're headed out! [Sadly.] No one likes code names anymore.,4,3,30
Lin,Copy that. Asami and I are on our way.,4,3,30
,"Asami and Lin pilot their respective airships and take off. Oogi rises and follows the airships. Cut back to Kai's prison, as the door opens, and Kai looks up.",4,3,30
Mako,Come on. We're getting you out.,4,3,30
Jinora,"Kai! [Runs and hugs him, than kisses him on the cheek; Kai smiles in a frozen stance.]",4,3,30
Bolin,Whoa! Tenzin's not gonna be happy about this!,4,3,30
Mako,Then don't tell him.,4,3,30
Bolin,How can I not? This is too juicy!,4,3,30
Kai,"[To Mako and Bolin.] Thanks for coming to get me. I'm really sorry about stealing your wallets, and running away, and getting you stuck on that train.",4,3,30
Bolin,[Sighs and goes to hug Kai.] We can't stay mad at you.,4,3,30
Mako,"Yes, we can! I had a lot of money in that wallet!",4,3,30
Jinora,"Guys, come on! [They run down the hall and turn a corner, but the rest of their path is blocked by three Dai Li agents.]",4,3,30
Dai Li sergeant,Deserting Her Majesty's army is high treason. Punishable by death! [The agents simultaneously bend rock gloves at the trio.],4,3,30
,Cut to Korra behind a wall. She stares at the courtyard outside the temple.,4,3,30
Korra,"[To Tenzin and Bumi.] Come on! It's clear. [They run out, not noticing Dai Li agents hiding on the structure of the temple, who quickly surround them.]",4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"So, you've discovered my elite army. I see their loyalty still needs some work.",4,3,30
Korra,These airbenders shouldn't be used as weapons! They have a right to choose their own paths.,4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"These airbenders are Earth Kingdom citizens, and I am their queen. Taking them will constitute an act of war. If you disobey me, I will bear down on you with the entire force of my kingdom!",4,3,30
Korra,They're leaving with me!,4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"No, they're not!",4,3,30
,"Hou-Ting turns and walks away, and the first row of Dai Li agents begins bending rock gloves at Team Avatar and the airbenders. All of the airbenders begin bending blasts of air back at the Dai Li, attempting to hold their ground while the airship ladder lands to give them a lift.",4,3,30
Bumi,Come on!,4,3,30
,"The scene shifts to Kai, Jinora, Mako, and Bolin, who are still fighting the three agents. Mako avoids a rock glove, and he and Bolin fire attacks back at the agents, who successfully evade Mako's attack. However, one of them is knocked against the wall by an earth pillar sent by Bolin. Another agent charges and receives the same fate. Mako firebends at the last remaining agent, who stops the blast with an earth pillar. He sends a rock glove spiraling quickly at Jinora, and manages to capture her into his grip. Close-up on Kai's face with a look of shock, followed by anger. He charges at the agent, avoiding a boulder sent his way, and fires two air bending blasts to knock the agent backward and free Jinora.",4,3,30
Kai,[Standing over the grunting agent.] I guess I am as good as I thought.,4,3,30
,"Cut to the airship, as two final airbenders enter. Cut to Lin in the control room, listening to her walkie-talkie.",4,3,30
Bumi,Everyone's in. Let's go!,4,3,30
,"Cut to Tenzin and Korra, who are firing air blasts at Dai Li agents attempting to climb the temple and stop the escape. Tenzin whistles for his bison.",4,3,30
Tenzin,Oogi!,4,3,30
,"Tenzin and Korra jump on and Oogi begins to fly away, as the Earth Queen looks on.",4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"[To two Dai Li agents next to her.] Take down those airships! [The agents begin bending rocks at the bison, and one narrowly misses Korra's head.]",4,3,30
Korra,"Where are the others? [Cut to Bolin, Mako, Jinora and Kai running down the temple steps.]",4,3,30
Bolin,[Screaming at the top of his lungs.] We need help!,4,3,30
,"Dai Li agents rise to new heights on earth pillars, and begin firing down at the escapees. Korra steers Oogi away from the airship.",4,3,30
Bolin,"Everybody, hang on.",4,3,30
,"Bolin sends himself and his allies into the air with an earth pillar, as Oogi flies over to break their fall.",4,3,30
Kai,"Whoa, that was awesome!",4,3,30
,"Cut back to the Earth Queen, who points at Oogi and the airship flying off in the distance. Pieces of Oogi's fur fall onto her face.",4,3,30
Hou-Ting,"Bring me those airships now! [Sneezes.] Oh, get it off me! [Sneezes again.] Get this fur off my- [Sneezes for a third time; looks disgruntled as her hat falls crooked and covers part of her face.]",4,3,30
,Cut to Oogi and the airships fully escaping. Cut to the airships landing near ruins atop a range of hills in the desert. Cut to Tenzin and Korra standing before the airbenders.,4,3,30
Tenzin,"I know that none of you chose to become airbenders. But now you do have a choice. We can relocate you somewhere safe, or you can come with me to the Northern Air Temple, to live in peace and train as Air Nomads. You are no longer anyone's property. What path you decide is up to you.",4,3,30
Yung,I want to go with you.,4,3,30
Other airbender #1,Me too.,4,3,30
Other airbender #2,Count me in.,4,3,30
,"As more airbenders agree to go with Tenzin, tears form in his eyes as he smiles.",4,3,30
Korra,Good luck at the Northern Air Temple. I'll send more airbenders your way when I find them.,4,3,30
Tenzin,Be careful out there. Stay safe.,4,3,30
Korra,"I'll try. Seems like wherever I go, I make a new enemy.",4,3,30
Tenzin,"But you made some new friends too. You did well, Korra. [They hug.]",4,3,30
Korra,This is only the beginning.,4,3,30
,"Cut to the airship and Oogi, simultaneously rising and flying off in different directions. Cut to credits.",4,3,30
,"The scene opens an open field, where Naga jumps and catches a ball with her mouth before making her way to Korra. As Naga drops the ball in front of Korra, she airbends the ball away from the airship, getting Naga to fetch it back.",5,3,31
Lin,"While you're playing fetch, four of the most dangerous criminals are hunting you down. We should get moving.",5,3,31
Korra,"Relax, we just got here. Besides, no one knows where I am except us. [As Naga returns and drops the ball, Korra pats her.] I think she wants you to throw it for her.",5,3,31
,"Cut to a close-up of Lin, who looks down. Cut to the saliva and grass-coated ball with Naga's whining heard in the background. Cut back to Lin, who keeps looking down for a few seconds before glancing at Korra.",5,3,31
Lin,"I'll pass, thanks.",5,3,31
Asami,We just got a call from the radio about another airbender.,5,3,31
Korra,Finally! Where are they?,5,3,31
Mako,"A city called Zaofu, [Lin visibly becomes uneasy and uncomfortable.] the home of the Metal Clan.",5,3,31
Korra,You know the place?,5,3,31
Lin,[Uneasily. Looks to the side.] Uhh ... Never been there. [Folds her arms.] But I don't want you going there. I would rest a lot easier if you were back at Republic City.,5,3,31
Korra,"Sorry, if there's an airbender in Zaofu, then that's where we are going next.",5,3,31
,"Lin glares to the side and puts her head down in disappointment. Naga bends down and nudges the ball over to Lin with her nose. The metalbender regards the polar bear dog for a moment before bending out her cable and slapping it against the ball, thereby puncturing it and causing it to deflate as she leaves. Naga is left upset after Lin bursts it using her cables. Naga looks down at the deflated ball and lowers herself down, pawing at it, attempting to roll it on the ground. She makes a sad whining noise and her tail sags. The scene shifts to an aerial view of the plains he police airship, flying through the clouds and over the city of Zaofu. As the clouds past, a huge gleaming city made entirely out of metal in the shape of a lotus flower is seen. There are smaller metal flowers around the city too.",5,3,31
Bolin,"[Excitedly.] Wow! Wow! Wow! [Cut to the dashboard of the ship as all four amazed teenagers look out the windows.] An entire city made of metal! Wohoho, [Turns and looks at Lin.] you should feel right at home, Beifong.",5,3,31
,Lin is seated on a bench far away from the windows with her arms crossed. Naga and Pabu are near her.,5,3,31
Lin,[Unexcited.] Hmm ...,5,3,31
,"Cut to a close-up of Korra, who appears to be a little unhappy at Lin's behavior and pouts at her. Camera pans out to the landing pad of the city. The police airship proceeds to land at one of the stations controlled by metalbenders. A metalbender uses and bends a string of cable out of the crane and it loops itself around a hook under the airship to connect the metal cable to the airship. Two other metalbenders subsequently bend and build an intricate stairway for the airship's passengers. Cut to the interior, where Bolin runs out excitedly, while the rest of Team Avatar walks out calmly. Lin is slumped on the seat and still seated in the background, uninterested.",5,3,31
Bolin,Yeah!,5,3,31
Asami,[Stops and turns to Lin.] Aren't you coming?,5,3,31
Lin,What's there to see? It's metal. Big whoop. Just find the airbender and let's get moving. Don't tell anyone I'm here.,5,3,31
Korra,Why not?,5,3,31
Lin,I don't need to explain myself to you. [Points to the team.] Just do what I say.,5,3,31
Korra,"[Annoyed.] Fine. [Rolls her eyes and walks away.] You got it, Chief Crankypants.",5,3,31
,"Team Avatar exits the airship, where they are greeted by a man in green and yellow robes and two Metal Clan escorts.",5,3,31
Aiwei,Avatar Korra. It is an honor to meet you. [Bows with his hands clasped.] My name is Aiwei.,5,3,31
Korra,[Bows back.] Thanks for having us.,5,3,31
Aiwei,[Gestures his hand to the group.] Is this everyone?,5,3,31
Korra,"[Looks behind.] Yup. [Looks back at Aiwei.] Just us. So, can I meet the new airbender?",5,3,31
Aiwei,"[Speaks a little stiffly.] Of course, [Gestures his palm out.] right this way.",5,3,31
,"Aiwei gestures for Team Avatar to follow him. The escorts close the gate after them and they descend down the dock. Cut to Air Temple Island, followed by the inside of the dining hall.",5,3,31
Ikki,"[Addressing two new airbenders.] And this is the Air Acolyte dining hall where everyone eats. And this is Daw. [Daw stops eating and turns around to look at them.] He's a new airbender too, [Puts his utensils down.] like you guys.",5,3,31
Daw,[Drops his bowl and airbends up. Bows down.] It's so nice to meet you. How exciting. New friends.,5,3,31
Zaheer,"[Off-screen.] Excuse me, hello? [He opens a door to the side, a hood covering his face.] My name is Yorru. [Pushes down his hood and enters the hall with a bald head and clean shaven face.] I heard this is the place to come for if you're a new airbender.",5,3,31
Meelo,"You got that right, stranger.",5,3,31
Zaheer,"Well, a couple of weeks ago, I woke up and suddenly I can do this. [Bends out a small vortex on his palm.]",5,3,31
Ikki,"[Excitedly.] Mom! [Pema and Kya, who are seated in the background, glance over.] Aunt Kya! [Raises both arms with glee.] We got another one!",5,3,31
,"Cut to Zaheer, who smiles at his successful deception. The scene shifts to an aerial shot of Zaofu, followed by the city, where a tram passes by. Cut to the interior of the tram, where Team Avatar and Aiwei are, while Bolin looks out excitedly.",5,3,31
Aiwei,"[As the tram passes a statue of Toph Beifong.] That statue honors the first metalbender, Toph Beifong, who expanded the possibilities of what benders were capable of. Here, everyone is encouraged to reach his, or her, highest potential.",5,3,31
Bolin,[Excitedly.] Does Toph live here? Are we going to get to meet her?,5,3,31
Aiwei,"I'm afraid not. [Bolin sighs and droops his arms down. Cut to Aiwei.] She would visit from time to time, but years ago she left to wander the world, in search of enlightenment. [The team looks a little downcast and the tram is shrouded in darkness as it enters a tunnel.] No one has seen her since. [Cut to an aerial view of the rail line as the tram makes its way to another metal flower.]",5,3,31
,"The tram continues its path and heads for the edge of Zaofu, stopping at the terminal. Cut to an aerial shot of the city's edge.",5,3,31
Korra,Wow. Is this where the airbender lives?,5,3,31
Aiwei,"Yes. But first, her mother wants to meet you.",5,3,31
,"Cut to the dance studio, where eight dancers are rehearsing on a flattened metal lotus flower. They fire metal cables to the ceiling, and four of them swing upward before landing, while the four bottom dancers bend the petals for their team-mates to land on. The dancers bounce from petal to petal, before jumping to the middle, where the flower closes. The dancers open the flower, where the inside dancers pose with graceful poise.",5,3,31
Korra,Is this some kind of combat training?,5,3,31
Aiwei,"Not exactly, they are rehearsing for a dance premiere next month.",5,3,31
Suyin,"[Turns to see Team Avatar, claps to her dancers.] That's it for today everyone. [She walks up to the Team.]",5,3,31
Aiwei,"Allow me to introduce the matriarch of the Metal Clan, Suyin.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Please call me Su. [Presses a fist into her palm as a greeting.] Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra. [Camera pans out to the rest of the Team and Korra is bowing too.] And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.",5,3,31
Mako,You've done your research.,5,3,31
Suyin,I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.,5,3,31
Korra,"So, you're a dancer.",5,3,31
Suyin,"[Pulling out a finger with every stated profession.] Dancer. Leader. Wife. Mother. Collector of rare meteorites. You'll find people here have many skills and interests. [Aiwei leans into Suyin's ear and whispers to her, causing her eyes to widen and she glances at him. After Aiwei moves away from Suyin, she turns and narrows her eyes with suspicion on the group unhappily.] Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you? [Cut to Korra who is surprised. Behind her, Bolin claps a hand over his mouth nervously.]",5,3,31
Korra,"[Surprised.] What? I, uh, I didn't. I mean ...",5,3,31
Bolin,Oh ...,5,3,31
Korra,How did you know I was lying?,5,3,31
Aiwei,"I'm a truth seer. When people lie, their heart rate and breathing increase. [Camera pans across Team Avatar who are bewildered.] I can sense the most subtle of changes.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Thanks to Aiwei, there are no secrets in our city.",5,3,31
Korra,[Relents remorsefully.] We came with Republic City's Chief of Police. She didn't want anyone to know she was here. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.,5,3,31
Suyin,"[Surprised and excitedly.] Lin's here? Well, I would love to say hello.",5,3,31
Korra,"Wait, you two know each other?",5,3,31
Suyin,"You're joking, right? [There's silence from the teens as they stare at each other awkwardly. A hurt Suyin sighs and looks to the side sadly.] Lin never told you about me.",5,3,31
Korra,No. Why would she?,5,3,31
Suyin,I'm Lin's sister.,5,3,31
,"Team Avatar listens to the news with surprise and disbelief. Cut to the police airship, where Lin looks at Zaofu, before the scene focuses on her reflection.",5,3,31
Korra,"[Off-screen.] I found out [Lin turns back in alarm.] why you're so against coming here. [View changes to show the Team and Suyin, now in her Zaofu attire, on the ship.] Why didn't you ever tell me you had a sister?",5,3,31
Lin,Half-sister.,5,3,31
Suyin,"Same mom, different dads, so what? [Puts her hand over her heart.] We're blood, Lin, and after thirty years, the least you could do is say ""hello"".",5,3,31
Lin,[Bitterly.] I have nothing to say to you.,5,3,31
,Camera angle changes to a close-up of an angry Lin. The blurred background clears up with the rest of the party looking sad. Korra is a little annoyed. Fade to black and back to a view of Lin's police airship on the hangar bay.,5,3,31
Korra,[Off-screen.] You two haven't spoken in thirty years? How come? [View changes to the inside of the ship with the Beifong sisters.],5,3,31
Suyin,"Ask her, I've tried.",5,3,31
Lin,"Oh, don't put that on me. [Lin points a finger to Su and her sister places her arms akimbo.] You're the one who tore our family apart.",5,3,31
Suyin,[Smugly and sarcastically.] And you've done a bang up job keeping it that way.,5,3,31
Lin,"You haven't changed one bit, have you?",5,3,31
Suyin,"Look, we can stay here arguing about the past all day, but that's not reason the Avatar came here. [To Korra.] My daughter is thrilled to meet you.",5,3,31
Korra,"Lin, your niece is the new airbender! Isn't that amazing?",5,3,31
Lin,[Blankly.] Yeah. Terrific.,5,3,31
,"Cut to a field with metal columns, where a metal disc ricochets between, with a player on each side.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Those are my two youngest, Wei and Wing. They're playing a game called Power Disc. They invented it all on their own.",5,3,31
,"Wing shoots the disc to Wei, who redirects it, ricocheting it between multiple columns. Wei fires the disc back, ricocheting against a column. Wing leaps to intercept the disc, but fails to catch it, which slams onto a net.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Oh, nice power, Wei.",5,3,31
Wei,[As Wing pounds his hands and grumbles at his defeat.] Ha! Wing goes down!,5,3,31
Suyin,"I'm so proud of those two. [The group walks away. Cut to the group heading to a gallery filled with metal sculptures, where a sculptor works on one with metalbending.] Huan, I'd like you to meet the Avatar and her friends. And your Aunt Lin.",5,3,31
Korra,Nice to meet you.,5,3,31
Huan,[Without looking back.] Hey. [Korra looks confused.],5,3,31
Bolin,"Wow, that's a really nice ... banana? Yes, very, very lifelike.",5,3,31
Huan,[Cut to Huan's back view. Sighs. Turns to Bolin and speaks irritably.] It's not a banana! It was inspired by Harmonic Convergence; represents the dawning of a New Age. [Bitterly.] Obviously.,5,3,31
Bolin,"Oh, yeah, no, uh, I can, I can totally see that. [Mako and Asami look amused in the background and they start walking off. Forms a frame with his fingers.] I can, oh, let me stand here. Yes, I can see that now. Yes. Thank you. [Walks off, speaking away in a mocking fashion.] Banana. [Whispers to Mako.] I mean, that's a banana right?",5,3,31
,Cut to a view of a mountain and the camera pans down to the group walking toward a slightly younger teenaged lady reading a book on a bench.,5,3,31
Suyin,"And this is my daughter, Opal.",5,3,31
Opal,"[Turns toward the guests.] Wow, Avatar Korra. [Stands up.] I can't believe you're here. You are so amazing.",5,3,31
Korra,"It's great to meet you, Opal.",5,3,31
Bolin,Opal. That's a beautiful name.,5,3,31
Opal,[Blushes and pushes some hair behind her ear.] Thanks.,5,3,31
Bolin,I'm Bolin. [Extends a hand out.],5,3,31
Opal,"Opal. [Shakes Bolin's hand.] But, uh, you already knew that.",5,3,31
,Korra glances back and forth between the two with amused curiosity. Bolin looks off awkwardly while Lin storms toward them.,5,3,31
Lin,Great. We've found the airbender. Let's take her back to the airship and get out of here.,5,3,31
Suyin,And the woman apparently trying to abduct you is your aunt Lin.,5,3,31
Opal,Really? I've always wanted to meet you. My mom has told so many stories about you.,5,3,31
Lin,[Annoyed and coldly.] I'm sure she has. [Opal looks confused by Lin's behavior.],5,3,31
Suyin,So I've set all of you up in the guesthouses while Korra trains Opal.,5,3,31
Korra,"Oh, I'm sorry. But I was hoping she could train with the rest of the airbenders at the Northern Temple.",5,3,31
Opal,That sounds amazing.,5,3,31
Suyin,Nonsense. This is where Opal's home and family are. You can train her here.,5,3,31
Korra,I guess I could help her get started.,5,3,31
Lin,Absolutely not! We're leaving.,5,3,31
Korra,She's just a little worried because there's a bunch of crazy criminals after me.,5,3,31
Suyin,"If you're concerned about security, don't be. This is the safest city in the world. [Lin rolls her eyes in annoyance.] Now I'll see you all at dinner. And come hungry. My chef will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth.",5,3,31
Korra,"Why do you have such a problem with your sister? She seems nice. [Lin glares at her.] Come on, we can stay a little while. [Lin seethes while looking to the side and growling.]",5,3,31
,"Cut to the garden, where Opal and Korra are standing.",5,3,31
Korra,Okay. Let's see what you've got.,5,3,31
Opal,[Unsure.] I'm not very good.,5,3,31
Korra,"That's okay. I've never been a teacher before, so we're in the same boat. [Airbending stance.] You'd want to keep your elbows in, torso straight, feet just skimming the ground. Why don't you try it with me?",5,3,31
,"Opal follows Korra's movements and they circle each other. Soon, both bend out a stream of air which circles them, and they continue their movement.",5,3,31
Korra,Woah. You're a natural.,5,3,31
Opal,You really think so? Thanks.,5,3,31
,"Cut to an overhead shot of the duo training, which fades to a shot of the airbending gates of Air Temple Island. A female airbender slams against the gates before tumbling out. She rubs her head as Meelo, Daw, Zaheer, and another male airbender look on.",5,3,31
Meelo,[Sternly.] You call yourself an airbender? Disgraceful!,5,3,31
,"Meelo sternly points to the gates, prompting Daw to run in with no greater success.",5,3,31
Meelo,[Leaning over a prone Daw.] Be the leaf!,5,3,31
Daw,"But, I don't even know what that means.",5,3,31
,"Zaheer calmly walks past them, causing the duo to look up curiously. He somersaults through the front panels and avoids every other gate. The rest of the group look on in surprise as Kya walks up to them. Cut to Zaheer who nimbly avoids the gates, before somersaulting through the final gates. Zaheer turns and clasps his hands in respect.",5,3,31
Meelo,"Now, that man is a leaf.",5,3,31
Zaheer,A student is only [Bows.] as good as his master.,5,3,31
,Meelo bows respectfully back to Zaheer.,5,3,31
Kya,Great news! I just got a message from Tenzin. He's with a whole group of other airbenders at the Northern Temple and he wants all of you to join them. [Daw and the two other new airbenders smile at the news.] We leave first thing in the morning.,5,3,31
Zaheer,And the Avatar is with him?,5,3,31
Kya,[Slightly confused.] No. Apparently she had to split off from Tenzin.,5,3,31
Zaheer,[Disappointed.] That's unfortunate. I was really looking forward to meeting her.,5,3,31
,"Cut back to Zaofu at night, where the metal panels surrounding the city close. The scene changes to the dining area.",5,3,31
Chef,"Tonight, for your dining pleasure, I present a seared wild Kyoshi elephant koi, paired with a ginger-infused pea tendril and hibiscus root salad.",5,3,31
Suyin,Stunning.,5,3,31
,"The chef bows before walking off, where he bows to Baatar as they cross paths.",5,3,31
Baatar,"[As Baatar Jr. walks past him with a stack of paperwork.] Sorry, dear, I'm going to have to take dinner to my office. I just had a major breakthrough on the tram station remodel.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Well, don't let me stand away an inspiration.",5,3,31
Baatar,You're the best!,5,3,31
Suyin,"[To Korra.] That was my brilliant architect of a husband, Baatar, and our oldest son. He engineers all my husband's projects.",5,3,31
Lin,Five kids. What a nightmare.,5,3,31
Suyin,"No, no. My children are a blessing.",5,3,31
Lin,"Yeah, mom used to say that too, but she never meant it.",5,3,31
Bolin,"Mmmm. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical when he said ""pea tendrils"", [Laughs.] but this is delicious.",5,3,31
Opal,"[Laughs.] I know, right. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in my life.",5,3,31
Bolin,"Oh. I had plenty when Mako and I were living in the streets. [Opal looks at him sympathetically.] I mean, you'd be surprised how bad food from a dumpster can be.",5,3,31
Opal,I'm sorry. I didn't know.,5,3,31
Bolin,"No, no, it's okay, that's all in the past. Things are great now. I got to be a pro-bender, fought against a dangerous revolution, became a mover star, and now, I'm helping the Avatar rebuild a whole nation.",5,3,31
Opal,[Envious.] Wow. Your life sounds so exciting.,5,3,31
Suyin,How's your search for the new airbenders going?,5,3,31
Korra,"Honestly, not great. We had to rescue a whole group of them from the Earth Queen.",5,3,31
Suyin,"Oh, she's horrible. She thinks she can just do whatever she wants.",5,3,31
Lin,Sounds familiar.,5,3,31
Suyin,What?,5,3,31
Lin,Nothing.,5,3,31
Suyin,"I mean, the idea of even having a queen is so outdated. Don't you agree, Korra?",5,3,31
Korra,I ... I haven't really thought about it too much.,5,3,31
Suyin,"Well, you should start. The world is evolving and the Earth Queen can evolve with it or step aside.",5,3,31
Lin,"[Sarcastically.] Hey, everyone. My little sister is an expert on world affairs now.",5,3,31
Suyin,You want to talk about what's really bugging you? Because I'm right here!,5,3,31
,"Lin glares bitterly at her sister before turning away. Cut to Varrick and Zhu Li, who enter the hall.",5,3,31
Varrick,"Sorry we're late, everyone.",5,3,31
Bolin,"[Gasps, excitedly.] Varrick!",5,3,31
Asami,What are you doing here?,5,3,31
Varrick,"Great question, Asami. I mean, what are any of us doing here? Wow, food for thought. Any who, how's our company doing?",5,3,31
Asami,You mean my company. Future Industries reverted back to me after you plotted to abduct the President.,5,3,31
Varrick,Allegedly plotted to abduct the President. Never convicted.,5,3,31
Mako,"Uh, that's because you escaped prison.",5,3,31
Varrick,"No, the universe decided to set me free. So, I looked up my old friend Suyin here, pitched her a few ideas, [Smacks the table.] and bam! We're in business together.",5,3,31
Suyin,Varrick's heading up my new technology division.,5,3,31
Varrick,"[Dramatically.] I've seen the future, and the future is, magnets! I'm working on a high speed rail that would revolutionize transportation and shipping as we know it. But that's not all, I'm-",5,3,31
Lin,"[Snaps.] All right, enough! [Stands.] I'm trying to keep the Avatar safe and you're harboring a criminal?",5,3,31
Suyin,"Ease out, Lin. Sure Varrick's made a few mistakes in his past, but that doesn't mean he should pay for it for the rest of his life. My chef was a pirate, but now he's a culinary master. People change.",5,3,31
Lin,"[Points her finger accusingly.] You haven't. [Walks off, throwing the chair aside.]",5,3,31
Korra,Lin!,5,3,31
,"Lin exits the hall, firing her cable to slam the door. Cut to the bathroom, where Mako is styling his hair, while Bolin brushes his teeth.",5,3,31
Mako,"So, you and Opal seemed to hit it off dinner. I think she's really into you.",5,3,31
Bolin,"Yeah, I know. She's sweet and pretty and super nice. Too bad she's not my type.",5,3,31
Mako,"Right, I forgot. Your type is dumb mover star or psycho ice princess.",5,3,31
Bolin,"[Spits out his toothpaste.] You know, that really hurts a little bit. Right ... [Presses a fist to his chest.] here. [Looks at mirror, adjusting his hair.] Maybe you're right, bro. Maybe Opal is Bolin material. Thanks. [Flirts with his reflection.] Yeah!",5,3,31
,"Cut to Suyin's study, where Korra admires a model of Zaofu.",5,3,31
Suyin,"You know, before I built this city, there was nothing here. I wanted to make my mark on the world.",5,3,31
Korra,It's amazing. Thank you for being so welcoming. And I'm sorry for how Lin's been acting. Can I ask what happened with you two?,5,3,31
Suyin,"It's complicated. We didn't have a normal childhood. Neither of us knew our fathers and Toph was always busy being Chief of Police. Because mom grew up in such a strict household, she gave us all the freedom in the world, hoping we'd figure out our own paths.",5,3,31
Korra,That sounds like a good thing.,5,3,31
Suyin,"And in a way it was. But we both ended up fighting for mom's attention. Lin followed in her footsteps and became a cop. I was ... more of a rebel. Mom wasn't too happy with how either of us turned out. When I was sixteen, I left home to explore the world. [Pan to show Suyin's various collections and photographs.] I sailed the seas on a pirate ship, joined a traveling circus for a while, and lived in a sandbender commune in a desert. It took me a while, but, I finally realized what I was looking for was a family. So I bought this plot of land, found a brilliant architect who later became my husband, and created a place I could truly call home.",5,3,31
Korra,It sounds like you've created the perfect life here.,5,3,31
Suyin,"[Downcast.] Almost. I've always wanted Lin to be a part of it, but I gave up hope long ago of her ever coming around.",5,3,31
,"Korra looks away sympathetically. Cut to a pavilion, where Opal is training her airbending.",5,3,31
Bolin,"[Flirting.] Hey, lady. Wow, you really blowin' me away with your airbending. [Pretends to airbend.] Ahhh, woo-woosh, psst.",5,3,31
Opal,Why are you acting weird?,5,3,31
Bolin,Why are you acting weird?,5,3,31
Opal,I don't like how you're talking to me. [Walks off.],5,3,31
Bolin,"[Chases after Opal.] Look, I'm sorry. I just get really self-conscious when I know when a girl likes me, and I-I end up looking stupid.",5,3,31
Opal,Who said I liked you?,5,3,31
Bolin,Oh no. But I though ... Mako said-,5,3,31
Opal,"Just kidding. But, do me a favor and stop trying. [Bolin looks crestfallen.] Look, don't stop trying. Just stop trying so much. Just be yourself.",5,3,31
Bolin,"Huh. Be myself. Yeah, I guess I can give that a shot.",5,3,31
,Bolin and Opal look at each other romantically. Korra clears her throat to make her presence known.,5,3,31
Opal,"Oh, hey Korra.",5,3,31
Korra,Can I steal you away from Bolin for a minute? I need you help with something.,5,3,31
,"Opal walks off with Korra, bidding farewell to Bolin on the way. Cut to Air Temple Island, where Zaheer walks into Tenzin's study. He looks at a small shrine of an Air Nomad and takes the amulet, with a sculpting of Guru Laghima. He opens the amulet to read the inside inscription.",5,3,31
Zaheer,"""Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind.""",5,3,31
Ikki,What are you doing? No one's allowed in Daddy's study except Daddy.,5,3,31
Zaheer,I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.,5,3,31
Ikki,What were you reading?,5,3,31
Zaheer,"A poem by Guru Laghima, the wisest airbender who ever lived.",5,3,31
Kya,"[Walks in, interrupting the two of them.] Ikki, you should be in bed. C'mon.",5,3,31
Ikki,Night.,5,3,31
Zaheer,Good night.,5,3,31
Kya,[Suspicious.] You seem to know a lot about airbender history for someone who just got airbending.,5,3,31
Zaheer,I've always admired the culture.,5,3,31
Kya,And you moved through those gates like a natural. Where did you say you were from?,5,3,31
Zaheer,A small village up north. You've probably never heard of it.,5,3,31
Kya,Wait. [Her eyes shoot open as she realizes who he really is.] Zaheer!,5,3,31
,"Kya bends the water in the fountain and directs it at Zaheer, who blasts it off with airbending. Kya bends the water around her and shoots ice projectiles at him. Zaheer takes a staff and smashes the ice projectiles. He leaps out through the window and opens the staff, preparing to escape. Kya leaps out with water tendrils on either arm.",5,3,31
Kya,I need some help!,5,3,31
,"Kya catches Zaheer with her tendrils, leaping down before slamming him to the fountain. She prepares to freeze him, though Zaheer managed to dodge the attack in the nick of time, having only his leg frozen, which he easily broke through. Kya bends the water into a wave and rides toward him, directing all the water to Zaheer, but he shields himself with airbending and blows her off. Zaheer prepares to grab his staff, but is blocked by a fire blast.",5,3,31
White Lotus sentry,Hold it right there!,5,3,31
,"The two sentries direct fire blasts at Zaheer, which he nimbly dodges. Zaheer pulls the staff with airbending, using the staff to block another blast before throwing a blast of air to slam the sentries against the roof of a pavilion. Kya, who has regained consciousness, bends the water to surround herself, before directing a strong blast toward Zaheer. Zaheer dodges the blast and sends a large air blast to Kya, slamming her against the wall, knocking her out.",5,3,31
Zaheer,"Sorry, I won't be joining you at the Northern Air Temple. I'm afraid I have other plans.",5,3,31
,"Zaheer opens his staff and flies off. Cut to the streets of Zaofu before switching to a room where Lin, in her undershirt, is reading a newspaper.",5,3,31
Lin,[Hearing a door knock.] Who is it?,5,3,31
Korra,"Hey, it's me. I brought someone who wants to talk to you. [Opal appears behind the door.]",5,3,31
Lin,You want to talk? Then talk.,5,3,31
Opal,"I'm sorry being here has been so hard for you. When you showed up, I was so excited to get to know you. I heard so many great things about you from mom and Grandma Toph. So, I guess I was kind of sad you didn't want to know me. [Lin looks on, annoyed.] Believe me, I know my family can be a little crazy and overwhelming some times. But I would love it so much if you would be a part of it.",5,3,31
Lin,Get out.,5,3,31
Opal,"[Shocked.] Sorry, did I say something wrong?",5,3,31
Lin,[Seething.] Get out!,5,3,31
,Opal tears up and runs away. Korra looks on helplessly and approaches Lin.,5,3,31
Korra,What's your problem? Don't get mad at Opal. I asked her to talk to you because I thought it would help you snap out of whatever funk you're in. But I guess I was wrong.,5,3,31
Lin,"Why don't you focus on fixing the world, and stop trying to fix my family?",5,3,31
Korra,"Su's right. You're never going to change. You're always gonna be a bitter, lonely woman.",5,3,31
,"Korra storms out of the room. Cut to Lin, with her hand on her face, as a tear runs down her cheek.",5,3,31
,Fade to credits.,5,3,31
,The scene opens with a morning view of Zaofu. The metal dome covering Zaofu opens. Team Avatar and Suyin's family are sitting at the table for breakfast.,6,3,32
Mako,"Hey, has anyone seen Chief Beifong?",6,3,32
Korra,I think she's still sulking in her room.,6,3,32
Suyin,"I know she has a problem with me, but she had no right to yell at Opal last night. [Wei and Wing run into the room.] All set for your power disc game, guys?",6,3,32
Wing,"[While Wei takes a few pieces of fruit from the basket.] Yeah, all set to kick Wei's butt. [Snatches an apple.]",6,3,32
Wei,"I wanna power disc your face. [Smacks Wing in the stomach, causing him to choke on the apple. To Korra.] You should go play with us.",6,3,32
Korra,"Um. I don't think I'd be much competition, since I can't metalbend.",6,3,32
Suyin,Really. Lin never offered to train you?,6,3,32
Korra,"Nope. And I guessed I never thought to bring it up because I was learning to airbend, then there was the pro-bending, then I got tied up fighting Equalists. It was a busy few months.",6,3,32
Suyin,"Well, it's probably for the best. I'm sure Lin would be a horrible teacher. [Chuckles with Korra.] As the Avatar, you should have mastery over all the elements. I'd be happy to show you the basics.",6,3,32
Korra,Really? That would be great!,6,3,32
Opal,"[To Bolin.] You should try it, too.",6,3,32
Bolin,"[Flinches visibly.] Uh, nah. I'm more of an earth guy. The dirt, rocks; y'know, maybe some light gravel. That's kinda where my heart is.",6,3,32
Suyin,"Okay, Earth Guy. Well, let me know if you change your mind.",6,3,32
,"Suyin's necklace begins to be pulled off. Cut to the table, where the cutlery begin shaking and being pulled away, causing everyone with duck for cover. Cut to a suit, where the cutlery flies and stick to. The person in the suit removes the helmet cover, revealing to be Varrick.",6,3,32
Varrick,"It worked! Zhu Li, mark it down. Magnet suit test successful. [Everyone peers out of the table.] Power down. [Zhu Li unplugs the suit, causing everything to drop.] On to phase two: Zhu Li cleans up this mess. [Zhu Li hangs her head in disappointment.]",6,3,32
,"The scene shifts to Lin walking outside of her room, as she sees two guards leaning against a wall and chatting.",6,3,32
Guard #1,How many push-ups did you do last night? 'Cause I did like fifty.,6,3,32
Lin,What do you two think you're doing?! Get back to work! [Groans uncomfortably and puts her hand on her face.],6,3,32
Aiwei,Is everything all right here?,6,3,32
Lin,"The Avatar is in danger, and these two knuckleheads are just standing around chit-chatting.",6,3,32
Aiwei,"Don't worry, Zaofu is the most secure city in the world.",6,3,32
Lin,"I'll be the judge of that. I'm going to check every inch of this place. [Tries to walk away, but Aiwei blocks her path.]",6,3,32
Aiwei,"Lin, you do not have to work while you are here. You need to relax.",6,3,32
Lin,I'm fine! [Groans uncomfortably again.],6,3,32
Aiwei,"It doesn't take a truth seer to know that you are under a dangerous amount of stress. If you don't deal with your suppressed feelings, there will be severe consequences to your health ... and your job.",6,3,32
Lin,I'm not interested in talking about my feelings.,6,3,32
Aiwei,You won't have to say a word. I know a great acupuncturist in town who will be able to help you. [He hands Lin a card.],6,3,32
Lin,Hmm.,6,3,32
,"Scene shifts to Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li's hideout in a vine-infested Republic City apartment.",6,3,32
P'Li,[To Zaheer.] Seems like you made quite the stir on Air Temple Island. The cops are swarming the city looking for us.,6,3,32
Ghazan,You still want to try to take out the president?,6,3,32
Zaheer,"No, he'll have to wait. We leave today.",6,3,32
,"Cut to the group, looking down at a view of street in Republic City.",6,3,32
Zaheer,There's our ticket out of here.,6,3,32
,"A truck driver is lifting boxes into the bag of his truck. Suddenly a water whip grabs hold of him, bent by Ming-Hua, and pulls him to the side of his truck. Terrified, he looks at Zaheer and P'Li, who are standing in front of him and glaring at him. Directly behind the driver, subduing him with an ice claw in one hand and holding an ice dagger at his neck, is Ming-Hua.",6,3,32
Driver,There's no money! I just made my last delivery!,6,3,32
Ming-Hua,We don't want money.,6,3,32
,"Cut to an operating room. Lin is lying on a bed, looking upward as Guo bends needles out of a tray and stops them right above her.",6,3,32
Lin,How many of those things are you going to stick in me?,6,3,32
Guo,"I'll be placing several needles on each of your acu-points. There's nothing to be scared about. [He is about to lower the needles into Lin, but she quickly lifts her head.]",6,3,32
Lin,I'm not afraid of needles!,6,3,32
Guo,"Please, close your eyes and take a deep breath. [Lin does so, and the needles slowly go into different spots in her upper body.] This process corrects an imbalance in your chi. Please tell me if you feel any pain or pressure.",6,3,32
Lin,I can't feel a thing.,6,3,32
Guo,That's unusual. Your chi must be powerfully blocked. We're going to need more needles. [While adding more needles.] Acupuncture often taps into peoples' buried memories. These memories can sometimes be difficult to process.,6,3,32
Lin,"[Skeptical, as a needle approaches her forehead.] Huh, buried memories. Uh-huh.",6,3,32
,"The scene manifests one of Lin's memories. A teenage Suyin is relaxing inside of her living room with two boys. The door opens and someone walks inside. It is Lin, who is also much younger.",6,3,32
Lin,"Su, what are you doing home?",6,3,32
Suyin,"[Laughs.] Wow, you almost look like a real cop!",6,3,32
Lin,You're supposed to be in school.,6,3,32
Suyin,"[Sarcastically.] Oh no, are you going to tell Mom? It's not like she's going to care.",6,3,32
Lin,"[To the boy who is sitting on the couch opposite Suyin, rummaging inside of a backpack.] Where'd you get all that stuff?",6,3,32
Boy,"Oh, it fell off the back of a truck.",6,3,32
Lin,What are you doing hanging out with these losers?,6,3,32
Suyin,"They're my friends and you have no right to call them that! Come on guys, let's get out of here.",6,3,32
Lin,"[Puts her hand on her sister's shoulder and stops her from leaving.] Su, stop.",6,3,32
Suyin,[Slaps Lin's hand off.] Get your hands off of me!,6,3,32
Lin,You have so much potential. You're ruining your life!,6,3,32
Suyin,At least I have a life!,6,3,32
,"Suyin turns and leaves with her friends, as Lin looks on with a glare. Cut back out of the memory to the present, as Lin's eyes are closed and her face quivers. Switch to Suyin and Korra walking.",6,3,32
Suyin,"[Stopping near a meteorite on a low pedestal.] These meteorites are perfect for beginning metalbenders. The metals have a unique property, making them easier to bend.",6,3,32
,"Suyin breaks off a piece of the meteorite, which she slowly bends down to her hand. Suyin bends it into a star shape, followed by a diamond.",6,3,32
Korra,That's amazing! [Suyin gives Korra the meteorite.],6,3,32
Suyin,"Here, try it!",6,3,32
Korra,Okay.,6,3,32
,"Korra concentrates for a while, but is not able to do anything with the meteorite. A noise is heard in the distance. Korra and Suyin look for the source, and see Bolin watching them, while hiding behind a large rock.",6,3,32
Korra,Bolin? Is that you?,6,3,32
Bolin,[Nervous.] No!,6,3,32
Korra,What are you doing? [Bolin steps out from behind the rock.],6,3,32
Bolin,"Oh, hey ladies. Just uh ... I was just looking for Pabu. Pabu!",6,3,32
Korra,He's on your shoulder.,6,3,32
Bolin,"[Eyes shift to his shoulder and see Pabu.] Oh, look there you are! [To Suyin and Korra.] You know, I thought something was chewing on my ear. Probably need to get a shot. Pabu has sort of a ... a venom. Anyways, so what are you guys doing? You metalbending over here or something?",6,3,32
Suyin,Want to give it a shot?,6,3,32
Bolin,"Nah, it's okay. I mean, only like one earthbender in a hundred can metalbend.",6,3,32
Suyin,"Well, don't believe everything you hear. The only thing limiting you is your attitude.",6,3,32
Bolin,"Well, maybe I'll just ... I'll just stay and watch. [Makes a rock stump for himself, and sits down. Korra turns back to the meteorite.]",6,3,32
Suyin,"Try to focus on the fine pieces of earth within the metal. [Korra takes Suyin's advice, and successfully changes the shape of the meteorite.]",6,3,32
Korra,I can't believe it! I'm metalbending!,6,3,32
Bolin,"[Downcast, with a catch in his voice.] Wow, you picked that up really, really quick. Guess you're that one in a hundred.",6,3,32
Suyin,"[Puts her hand on Korra's shoulder.] Great job, Korra.",6,3,32
,"Back to Lin's room, as the camera zooms back into her head and into yet another memory. Lin is driving in a police carriage, as an officer's voice comes out of the radio.",6,3,32
Radio,"Calling all units. Property reported on the corner of 5th and Harbor. Suspect's vehicle headed south on Hallow Boulevard. Units responding, identify.",6,3,32
Lin,[Picks up the radio and replies.] Unit three responding.,6,3,32
,"The criminal carriage drives by her, and she quickly turns around. Lin fires her cables at one of the wheels and rips it off, causing the carriage to swerve to the stop at the site of the road. Two people come out from the back and try to escape, but Lin traps them with her cables, glaring at them, until she hears a voice off-screen.",6,3,32
Suyin,Leave them alone! [Suyin steps out of the driver's seat of the wrecked carriage.],6,3,32
Lin,[Horrified and shocked.] Su?,6,3,32
,"The scene shifts out of the memory, as Lin opens her eyes, gasping, and sits up. The needles fly out of her and across of them. Lin breathes deeply, drenched in sweat, and turns to leave.",6,3,32
Guo,Wait! Leaving in the middle of a session could make you sick!,6,3,32
Lin,I'm done here.,6,3,32
,"Lin leaves, clearly in an unsafe condition. Cut to Lin in her room, face in hand. Her door opens and she looks up. It is Korra, but Lin hallucinates and sees her as a teenage Suyin.",6,3,32
Korra,"Are you going to stay in your room feeling sorry for yourself all day? [Lin shuts her eyes and tries to focus, causing her image of Suyin to fade to Korra.] You owe Opal an apology for the way you treated her last night. Are you okay? You don't look good. [Lin finds the strength to get up, as Korra walks into the room.]",6,3,32
Lin,I'm fine!,6,3,32
,"Lin leaves, stumbling at the door, and groaning uncomfortably on the way out. Lin heads back to the acupuncture room and barges open the door, startling Guo who is placing the needles back onto their tray.",6,3,32
Lin,What did you do to me?,6,3,32
Guo,"I tried to warn you. Come with me. Let's go finish the session. [He helps Lin back onto the bed and puts a needle in the point on her forehead, as the scene shifts back into the memory.] Just relax and breathe.",6,3,32
Lin,"So, you're robbing stores with the Terra Triad now?",6,3,32
Suyin,I didn't steal anything. I just drove the car. I owed my friends a favor. It's not a big deal.,6,3,32
Lin,I'm not letting you get away with this.,6,3,32
Suyin,"[Laughs.] Oh, what are you going to do, Officer? Arrest me? [She starts to walk away.]",6,3,32
Lin,Don't even think about taking one more step!,6,3,32
,"Suyin stops momentarily, but ignores her and keeps walking. Enraged, Lin sends one of her cables at her sister, and it catches her wrist. Suyin breaks free with her knife and sends the cables back at Lin, and the cables slice her cheek, causing Lin to scream in pain. Suyin looks on in shock. The scene leaves the memory with a sight of the present Lin, grunting and twitching her eyebrows. Cut to a bridge in Republic City, as a metalbending officer goes up to the same truck that was attacked by Zaheer's gang.",6,3,32
Officer,Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?,6,3,32
Driver,"I, uh, got a delivery to make at Bao Yu. I should be back later today. [Hands the officer papers, as Ming-Hua is shown behind his seat, still threatening him.]",6,3,32
Officer,You all right?,6,3,32
Driver,"Yeah, just a little tired. One more pick-up, then I'm clocking out.",6,3,32
Officer,I thought you said you had a delivery?,6,3,32
Driver,[Sweating and nervous.] Did I?,6,3,32
Officer,I'm going to need you to step out of the vehicle and open the back of the truck.,6,3,32
,"The driver steps out and runs away screaming, while another cop chases after him. The interrogating cop opens the back of the truck, and is blasted backward with powerful airbending from Zaheer.",6,3,32
Zaheer,Let's get out of here!,6,3,32
,"Ming-Hua drives the truck away, while police stay hard on its tail. P'Li blows up one of them with combustion, but the rest are able to avoid it, and keep chasing the truck. Ghazan stops two of them with lava, and the group escape. Back to Zaofu, as Bolin sneaks up behind a meteorite pedestal, whistling. He takes the meteorite from its pedestal and attempts to bend it.",6,3,32
Opal,"[From behind Bolin.] Hey, Bolin.",6,3,32
Bolin,"[Shocked, hides the meteorite.] Opal! Oh, wow, you ... really know how to sneak up on someone.",6,3,32
Opal,What are you doing?,6,3,32
Bolin,"Oh nothing, you know, just ... [Puts the meteorite back.] just thinking about my body and mustaches that I might have in the future. [The meteorite falls off the pedestal.]",6,3,32
Opal,You're acting weird again.,6,3,32
Bolin,"Sorry. I wasn't really thinking about all my mustaches. I'm just frustrated. I've been trying to metalbend and I can't figure it out. Don't tell anyone, okay?",6,3,32
Opal,Why not?,6,3,32
Bolin,"Because it's embarrassing. This isn't the first time I've tried, and I've been wanting to metalbend ever since I heard about Toph. Your grandmother is my biggest hero!",6,3,32
Opal,[Walks over and puts her hand on Bolin's shoulder.] My mom grew up learning from Toph. Just go train with her. Stop being so scared.,6,3,32
Bolin,"You know what? Maybe I am scared. But what about you? I know that you want to go to the Northern Air Temple to train with Tenzin, but you haven't done it, because you're afraid too!",6,3,32
Opal,You know what? You're right. I don't want to leave my family and disappoint my mom.,6,3,32
Bolin,"Look at us! Talking about our feelings, supporting each other. [Bolin and Opal hug.]",6,3,32
Opal,It's nice.,6,3,32
,"Back to Lin in the acupuncture room, as we go back into her memories. Suyin and Lin are sitting together in chairs in their mother's office, glaring at each other, as Toph paces.",6,3,32
Toph,"[Angrily, to Suyin, followed by Lin.] What were you thinking? And what were you thinking? You two have put me in an impossible position.",6,3,32
Lin,You're mad at me? [Glares at Suyin.] She's the one who was running around with criminals!,6,3,32
Suyin,[Glaring back.] This is all your fault!,6,3,32
Lin,I was doing my job!,6,3,32
Toph,"All right, enough! Here's what we're going to do. Su, you need to leave the city as soon as possible.",6,3,32
Suyin,What?! Where am I supposed to go?,6,3,32
Toph,"You'll go stay with your grandparents. Lin, give me the arrest report. [Lin obeys, and Toph rips it up.]",6,3,32
Lin,"Mom, what are you doing?! You can't cover this up! There are witnesses.",6,3,32
Toph,I'm the Chief of Police! I can't have a daughter in jail!,6,3,32
Lin,"So, once again, Suyin gets to do whatever she wants and there are no consequences. [Toph sits down and puts her head in her hands.]",6,3,32
Toph,This is our only option.,6,3,32
,Back to the operating room. Guo removes the needles.,6,3,32
Guo,"You're going to feel a bit fragile, so it's probably best if you take it easy for a while.",6,3,32
Lin,[Getting up and leaving.] I don't need to rest. I need to do something I should've done a long time ago.,6,3,32
,Back to Suyin and Korra metalbending.,6,3,32
Suyin,Congratulations. You're the first metalbending Avatar. [Bolin comes over to them.],6,3,32
Bolin,"So, umm, I've been thinking, and I'd like to try to learn metalbending. [Suyin walks up to him.] I mean, I'm sure you have a waiting list or something of a couple years so.",6,3,32
Suyin,Let's get started.,6,3,32
,"The ground cracks beneath them and a meteorite falls and breaks. Cut to show an angry, panting Lin.",6,3,32
Bolin,[Somewhat nervously to Korra.] I think Lin is mad about something.,6,3,32
Lin,"Su, it's time we talk.",6,3,32
Suyin,"After thirty years, you're finally ready to talk?",6,3,32
Lin,"When we were in Mom's office that day, you could've taken responsibility for what you did. But instead, you stayed quiet and let Mom throw her whole career away.",6,3,32
Suyin,Mom didn't throw her career away. She retired the next year. She was a hero.,6,3,32
Lin,You think she wanted to retire? She was so guilt-ridden about what she did to protect you that she didn't feel worthy of her badge.,6,3,32
Suyin,"Look, I admit that I was not a perfect kid and I've made some mistakes in the past but-",6,3,32
Lin,[Scoffs.] You made some mistakes?,6,3,32
Suyin,"[Hurt.] Lin, Mom and I already talked about this years ago and worked things out. If you had gotten together with us like we'd asked, you would know that I'm a different person now. I've been a different person for a long time.",6,3,32
Lin,"You think that just because you live in a big, fancy house, and have a chef who cooks you fancy food, that you're a different person? Maybe you could fool everyone else, but you can't fool me. I see right through you.",6,3,32
Suyin,"You know what, Lin? You're the one who hasn't changed. You're still a bitter loner who only cares about herself. No wonder Tenzin ended things with you years ago.",6,3,32
,"Lin bends a rock toward Suyin, which she deflects using her wrist.",6,3,32
Suyin,"Okay, [Fighting stance.] I guess this is how it's going to be.",6,3,32
,"Suyin trips Lin with a fissure, before knocking her off with a meteorite. Lin gets back up and earthbends a staircase, while Suyin metalbends a metal panel. Suyin bends the metal panel toward Lin, which she evades by using a backflip. Lin earthbends many fragments of small rocks to Suyin, who evades the attacks by weaving through.",6,3,32
Korra,[To Bolin.] Should I stop them?,6,3,32
Bolin,"You don't have any siblings, fighting is all part of the healing process.",6,3,32
,"The fight carries on with Lin earthbending toward Suyin, which she dodges with a cartwheel. Baatar, Huan, and the twins run to a pavilion.",6,3,32
Wei,[Shoulders Wing aside.] Go Mom!,6,3,32
,"The two of them continue to fight. Lin metalbends Huan's Harmonic Convergence sculpture, which Suyin deflects and smashes it into a metal wall.",6,3,32
Huan,"[Alarmed.] My sculpture! [Dashes over to survey the damage.] Actually, it looks ... kinda better now.",6,3,32
,"Suyin metalbends three metal panels toward Lin, which she deflects. Lin begins to earthbend rocks from beneath Suyin and bends a large boulder toward her. Suyin curls a part of the metal wall to shield herself before rolling it out again, knocking Lin into the pavilion nearby, where she lands roughly on the stairs, grunting.",6,3,32
Suyin,You've got it out of your system?,6,3,32
Lin,[Angrily.] Not quite yet!,6,3,32
,"Lin earthbends a part of the staircase leading to the pavilion, while Suyin earthbends a boulder from the ground. The two of them begins to charge at each other, but Opal interfered by airbending both objects to the side.",6,3,32
Opal,[Angrily.] What are you two doing?! You're sisters! Why would you want to hurt each other?,6,3,32
,"Both Suyin and Lin pants in exhaustion, and suddenly, Lin faints and falls to the ground, but Korra saved her head from knocking the ground. The scene cuts to a view of Suyin's estate in Zaofu before shifting to Korra, Bolin and Mako standing outside of Lin's quarters.",6,3,32
Korra,"Uhh, Whose going to knock? [Pushes Bolin closer to the door outside Lin's quarters.]",6,3,32
Bolin,"No, no, no, no, no, no! Not me! You're the Avatar, why can't you do it?",6,3,32
Korra,"Uhh, I can. But I just thought that ...",6,3,32
Mako,"I'll do it. [Knocks on Lin's door.] Uhh, Chief, you've been sleeping for sixteen hours. We just wanted to make sure that you're okay.",6,3,32
Lin,"[Lin pulls her door open, and Mako fall down. Lin, in Metal Clan attire, yawns and stretches her arms. Cheerfully.] Good morning. [Korra and Bolin look surprised after what happened before. Mako gets back on his feet.]",6,3,32
,The scene shifts to a drink being placed in front of Lin at the dining table.,6,3,32
Lin,What's this?,6,3,32
Chef,"I call it the kalenutsco. It's a mixture of kale, coconut water, and walnuts.",6,3,32
Lin,"[She tries and finishes the drink.] Not bad! [She sees Opal standing by the door of the dining room. She walks away from the dining room before returning upon Lin's request.] Opal, don't go. Please sit down, I want to talk to you. [Opal walks into the dining room before sitting down.] Look, I'm just not really comfortable talking about these kinds of things, and ... well, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about the other night.",6,3,32
Opal,It's okay.,6,3,32
Lin,Your mother and I have a complicated relationship and ...,6,3,32
Opal,It's probably difficult for you to be here.,6,3,32
Lin,"[Smiles.] You're a smart young woman, and an excellent airbender. I think it would be a wonderful opportunity to train with the other airbenders at the Northern Air Temple.",6,3,32
Opal,"There's a part of me that wants to go, but ... I don't want to upset my mom.",6,3,32
Lin,"When I was younger, all I wanted to do was please my mother. I became a police chief because I thought it would make her happy ... but it didn't. You need to make your decisions based on what you want. Don't make the same mistakes as I did.",6,3,32
,"Opal smiles and hugs her aunt. The scene shifts to Opal opening Suyin's office door, in which Suyin and Baatar are having tea.",6,3,32
Opal,"Mom, Dad, can I talk to you?",6,3,32
,"Opal shuts the door behind her. The scene shifts to a statue of Toph with Lin standing in front of it, and Suyin approaching her.",6,3,32
Suyin,Opal has decided to go to the Northern Air Temple. I guess you had something to do with her decision.,6,3,32
Lin,"Well, I was just ...",6,3,32
Suyin,"It's okay. I'm glad she was honest with me. I want her to do what makes her happy. Mom gave us too much freedom, but I feel like I made the mistake of giving Opal too little. I think it's about time I let her choose her own way. [Closes her eyes and opens them.] I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time when we were younger. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if Mom hadn't sent me away, if I had stayed in the city ...",6,3,32
Lin,You'd probably be in prison.,6,3,32
Suyin,"You're probably right. Mako told me that you're an excellent police chief. Republic City is lucky to have you. I know Mom is proud. [Lin looks at Toph's statue for a moment.] Can we move on? I'd love for you to be part of my life again. There's plenty of space in the house, and the kids would love having their aunt around. I do need a new co-director for my new dance performance.",6,3,32
Lin,"Whoa! Slow it down. How about for now, I just promise not to show up at your house and attack you again?",6,3,32
Suyin,Deal!,6,3,32
,"The two of them shake hands and smile at each other. The scene shifts to Zaheer's gang sitting around a camp fire, and Zaheer meditating.",6,3,32
Ming-Hua,We should've grabbed one of those cops. Maybe they know something about where the Avatar is hiding.,6,3,32
Ghazan,She could be anywhere.,6,3,32
P'Li,We'll find her. It's just a matter of time.,6,3,32
Zaheer,[Opens his eyes wide.] She's with the Metal Clan.,6,3,32
,Fades to credits.,6,3,32
,The scene opens to the Northern Air Temple. Cut to a scenic view of a grass plain with hills and the Northern Air Temple in the background. Various colorful spirits mingle and fly about.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"[Off-screen.] His pupils pleaded with their master [Camera cuts to a close up of the air temple.] to eat something, but he refused, [Cut to Tenzin who tells the story excitedly with a wistful smile.] just like he had each day during summer. [Cut to the airbenders who, except for Otaku, listen with disinterest.] Instead he meditated and got his nourishment from the universe. So when Tang Xu completed the ninety-seventh day of his historic fast on which island?",7,3,33
Otaku,[Puts his hand up.] Oooh! Oooh!,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Anyone besides Otaku, who already studied this in his acolyte training?",7,3,33
Otaku,"Ooh, ooh, ooh!",7,3,33
Tenzin,And is answering every question.,7,3,33
Otaku,"Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [Tenzin finally looks and glances at Otaku, prompting him to answer.] Whaletail Island.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"That is correct. Again. Now, on day ninety-eight ... [The recruits break out in laughter.]",7,3,33
Bumi,"[Speaking in a falsetto, as he capers about with his tunic over his head and Bum-Ju peeking out from the collar. Waves his hands around.] Greetings, air people. I come seeking boring stories to take back to the Spirit World.",7,3,33
,"Bum-Ju flies out of Bumi's tunic and he falls down on the ground. Everyone laughs again, including Jinora. Tenzin glares at his daughter, who quickly sits back in a disciplined posture and clears her throat. Cut to Tenzin and Oogi flying in the sky, showing this to the new recruits.",7,3,33
Kai,That is incredible! When do we get to fly around on our own sky bison like that?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Only after many years of practice and intense training. [Recruits moan off-screen.] Besides, we don't have enough bison here for all of you.",7,3,33
Kai,What about those? [Tenzin raises his eyebrows with surprise.] It's a whole herd of bisons. [Cut to an overhead view of the students standing at the balcony as they view a herd of air bison flying by. Tenzin walks up to them.],7,3,33
Tenzin,"Actually, the plural of bison is bison.",7,3,33
Recruits,Whoa! Cool! Wow look at that!,7,3,33
Kai,Can we ride those?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"No, that's a wild herd. It would take many years to tame them. Now, let's get back to our lessons.",7,3,33
,"Scene shifts to two sky bison carrying the new airbenders, Kya, Pema, Rohan, Meelo, and Ikki.",7,3,33
Meelo,[Off-screen.] Dad! [Tenzin raises his head and camera pans up to reveal two sky bison with people on them flying toward the temple. Ikki waves excitedly to her father while Meelo points to the bison behind him.] We brought you more airbenders!,7,3,33
,The two bison land on the ground.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Okay, everyone is dismissed. We'll pick this up ... [Sighs.] tomorrow. [As his wife and sister disembark.] How is everything in the city?",7,3,33
Pema,"Well, we had a little scare but everything is okay. Zaheer infiltrated the air temple.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Alarmed.] What! Is everyone all right?,7,3,33
Kya,"Everyone's fine. I fought with him, but he got away. And he stole some old necklace that had something to do with ... Guru ... Lak ... shmir.",7,3,33
Tenzin,Guru Laghima?,7,3,33
Kya,"Right ... you know I can never keep all those gurus straight. There were like a million of them. Remember that long, boring story about that guy who never ate?",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Unamused.] Yes ... I remember.,7,3,33
Air Acolyte member,Avatar Korra is calling on the temple's radio.,7,3,33
,The scene shifts to Tenzin picking up the microphone.,7,3,33
Tenzin,[To Korra.] Are you all right? Where are you?,7,3,33
Korra,"With Beifong's sister in Zaofu. We're totally safe, unless we get caught in another fight between Su and Lin.",7,3,33
Tenzin,Lin willingly took you to her sister?,7,3,33
Korra,Not exactly. We got a call about an airbender and it turned out to be Su's daughter Opal. She'll be headed your way soon.,7,3,33
Tenzin,[Excitedly.] Really? That's wonderful!,7,3,33
Bolin,"[Shoulders Korra aside and grabs the microphone.] She is wonderful, and pretty, [Tenzin and Korra get annoyed.] and so smart, and she smells like flowers ... [Notices Korra glaring.] Sorry. Bolin, out. [Slides out of view.]",7,3,33
Korra,How's the training going?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Not so well, I'm afraid. No one seems to be interested in the hard work of becoming part of the Air Nation.",7,3,33
Korra,"You need to give yourself a break. Let Jinora and the kids help you out, and what about Bumi? He was a naval commander, maybe he has some ideas about how you get people motivated.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Alarmed and angry.] Bumi?! He's my worst student.,7,3,33
Korra,"Yeah, but he loves to organize people. If you ask him for help, you can trick him into taking more responsibility by making him think the whole thing with his idea.",7,3,33
Tenzin,That actually sounds like a good plan. You're turning into a pretty wise Avatar after all.,7,3,33
Korra,"Conflict resolution, that's what I do.",7,3,33
,"Scene shifts to Jinora and Kai looking over the mountain ranges, observing a herd of bison.",7,3,33
Kai,We should go down there. I want to fly one of those bisons.,7,3,33
Jinora,I don't know. We might get in trouble.,7,3,33
Kai,Come on? Let's have some fun. We'll be back before anyone realizes we're gone.,7,3,33
Jinora,[Smiles a little.] I guess it would be all right.,7,3,33
,Kai and Jinora pick up their gliders to open them and fly down to the lake where the herd of bison is. A group of several spirits look up and watch Kai and Jinora flying and a few accompany them. A little bird-like spirit squeaks and flies in front of Jinora along with other kinds of flying spirits. Jinora gives a smile at the bird-like creature. Cut to an aerial view of the pair flying over a little mountain ridge as they catch sight of bison below near a watering hole.,7,3,33
Kai,Look! Baby bisons. [Cut to a close up of three baby bison as one grooms itself and the other two play fight with each other.] How come they're on the ground?,7,3,33
Jinora,"[View changes to a frontal shot of the duo.] Air bison calves can't fly after a week or two after they're born. So the entire herd will stay near the ground, near the valley. [Kai angles his glider downwards and flies off-screen.]",7,3,33
Kai,Let's go see the babies.,7,3,33
Jinora,Be careful. The mothers are very protective.,7,3,33
,"Kai lands, folds his glider, and proceeds to pet one of the calves.",7,3,33
Kai,"Aww, look how cute!",7,3,33
Jinora,"Kai, get out of there!",7,3,33
,"Jinora notices an adult bison approaching and flies toward Kai. Kai, paralyzed with fear, watches the angry adult bison charge toward him. Jinora flies past and grabs him out of harm's way.",7,3,33
Kai,"Wow, you really saved me down there. You know, you're an incredible airbender.",7,3,33
Jinora,"Well, I've been training for a long time.",7,3,33
Kai,"Then, why don't you have tattoos like an airbending master?",7,3,33
Jinora,My dad says I'm not a master yet.,7,3,33
Kai,"You can do everything your dad can. [Jinora looks at Kai, wide-eyed.] Plus, you have all these spirit-y powers. If anyone's a master, you are.",7,3,33
,"The girl blushes. Cut back to an aerial view of the courtyards outside the air temple, where Bumi is talking to three airbenders.",7,3,33
Bumi,"[Chuckles.] And so, we bring the net down on [Cut to Bumi regaling his tale to three airbenders. He has removed his Air Nomad top and is now wearing just a singlet.] the head pirate, and he looks around real sad and says, [Does his best impression of a pirate.] ""I knew I should have followed my dreams and become a dentist.""",7,3,33
Yung,"[Laughs.] How come you grow up to be so cool, while Tenzin became [Glares.] such a stick-in-the-mud?",7,3,33
Bumi,"[Contently.] Well, I guess cool is something you're born with.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"[Walking out of the temple from a small passage way leading to the courtyard.] Bumi, can I talk to you? [The airbenders walk away.]",7,3,33
Bumi,"Let me guess, you want to criticize me for something?",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Actually, I need your help.",7,3,33
Bumi,[Begins to dig his ear with his pinky.] Oh yeah. With what?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"I don't think I'm doing well with the new airbenders, and everyone knows you're a natural leader. [Smiles awkwardly at his brother.]",7,3,33
Bumi,"[Removes his pinky from his ear with a pop.] True, I did win the Admiral Tung Natural Leadership Award, twice.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Looks a bit skeptical but forces a pleasant smile.] What would you do if you were in charge? Help me be more like you.,7,3,33
Bumi,I'd love to. [Stands up before standing at attention.] You've got to use military discipline to whip these troops into shape. The only way to deal with new recruits is to [Punches a hand forward.] break them down so you can [Brings both hands up.] build them back up. Rule with an iron fist. [Clenches his hand into a fist.] Show them who the master is. [Waves his fist very close to Tenzin's face.],7,3,33
Tenzin,Thanks for the insight.,7,3,33
Bumi,My pleasure.,7,3,33
,"Cut to the temple at daybreak, where Tenzin barges into the dorm and uses airbending to blast a horn, waking all the airbenders.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Sternly.] Dawn patrol! Everyone up!,7,3,33
Bumi,What are you doing? It's barely light out.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"I'm taking your advice. I'm going to break you down and build you back up! [Cut to Bumi, with dark circles, who stares at Tenzin with disbelief and regret.] Now get moving recruit! [Bumi sighs.]",7,3,33
,"Cut to the mountainside, where Tenzin leaps up the mountain. Jinora follows next, followed by Kai, who stumbles, and the remaining airbenders, who grunt as they prop themselves up the plateaued summit.",7,3,33
Tenzin,Nothing like a ten-mile hike first thing in the morning.,7,3,33
Yung,[Shivering.] Don't these robes come in a warm bison fur version?,7,3,33
Tenzin,No! Of course not. [Yung scowls and looks away. Bumi stands up.],7,3,33
Bumi,"[Slumps onto the floor.] If it weren't so cold, I'd go right back to sleep.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Then, this is the perfect time to learn meditation and proper breathing technique. Airbenders are able to warm themselves only with their breathing. [Sits.] Everyone get into the lotus position. Ah, this is so much more refreshing than sleeping.",7,3,33
Bumi,[Crawls to his brother.] You know when I said that thing about an iron fist-,7,3,33
Tenzin,Hush! Meditation time. Focus.,7,3,33
,"Bumi sighs and returns to meditation. Cut to the temple, where there are multiple thin wooden posts. The airbenders all sport dark circles from fatigue.",7,3,33
Bumi,Can we go back to bed now?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Now that we're refreshed and loose from our hike and meditation, it's time for a balancing exercise. [Leaps onto a post, standing on one leg.] The key is to maintain your heaven and earth connection. [Pulls out a feather and levitates it with airbending.] Now you try. [Cut to the students struggling.] Back up your posts! It's not hard if you concentrate. [Bumi struggles to balance, before falling off.] Get back up! [Switch to a close-up of Tenzin.] What's the matter, you can't handle it, soldier? [Bumi glares and slides slowly out of view on his back as the feather drifts down to rest on his face.]",7,3,33
Jinora,Don't you think you're a little hard on them.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Don't worry, they can take it. You'll see. [To Otaku.] Ignore the lemurs digging in your ears. Concentrate on your breathing and, you won't even know they're there! [Otaku loses his balance and falls off, the lemurs take over his post. View changes to mid-morning at another courtyard. Cut to Tenzin shaving Daw's head, who looks sad as his hair drops off.] When the head is shaved, an airbender is able to feel the wind around him. It is both humbling and freeing.",7,3,33
Kai,"Hey, you want to go sneak away and check on the baby bisons?",7,3,33
Jinora,Shhh. You should be paying attention.,7,3,33
,"Cut to a slightly surprised Kai who shrugs and walks away. Tenzin polishes Daw's scalp, which shines.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"All right, who's next?",7,3,33
Yung,I'm not sure I want to shave my head.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"That's fine, shaving your head is a personal choice.",7,3,33
Daw,"[Shocked.] Wait, what?",7,3,33
Tenzin,Anyone else? [Everyone shakes their head.] Fine! Then we can get to our next training exercise: obstacle course. [Everyone moans.],7,3,33
Jinora,You're pushing too hard. Maybe we should give them a break.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"Jinora, I have this under control",7,3,33
,"Jinora glares at her father. Cut to the obstacle course, which is filled with spinning bells. A female airbender weaves through the bells.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Concentrate! Remember, airbenders move like the wind.",7,3,33
,"The airbender weaves through the bells and smiles, before she is struck by a watermelon, plunging into the mud. Cut to Ikki and Meelo, where the former is loading a cannon with watermelons, while the latter smirks and continues firing the cannon. Cut to a rope obstacle, where Otaku is hanging for dear life, while the previous female airbender crosses before being struck by another watermelon. Kai runs through the rope, causing Otaku to lose his grip. Kai runs up the course and confronts the next obstacle: a cactus-ridden balancing obstacle.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Stay light on your feet, and you'll never feel the stinging rash cactus.",7,3,33
,"Kai easily leaps through the balancing poles, before crashing into Yung and causing both to fall into the cactus patch. Cut to the cliff, where Kai leaps up with ease, overtaking Bumi and Otaku.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Everyone is waiting for you, Bumi. If you don't make it over the next thirty seconds, they'll all have to run through the course again!",7,3,33
Airbenders,"You can do it, Bumi! Come on!",7,3,33
,"Bumi leaps to the next ledge, loses his grip, and plunges into the mud.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Get back up the wall, recruit! You're letting your fellow airbenders down.",7,3,33
Bumi,[Angrily.] I'm finished! I've never wanted to be an airbender and I'm too old to be back in boot camp. [Walks away.] Count me out!,7,3,33
Tenzin,"[Furiously.] Fine, quit! We don't need your attitude in the new Air Nation.",7,3,33
Daw,"Master Tenzin, when do we get to go home and visit our families?",7,3,33
Tenzin,Go home? You just got here.,7,3,33
Female airbender,When's dinner? I'm starving.,7,3,33
Yung,Can I change out of my robe now? It's itchy.,7,3,33
Kai,This is just as bad as the Earth Queen's prison.,7,3,33
Tenzin,"[Snaps.] I'm tired of all this complaining! Jinora, take over!",7,3,33
Jinora,"Does this mean, I'm the master now?",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Yes, just lead them through some basic exercises.",7,3,33
Jinora,"Well, since I'm a master, when do you think I can get my tattoos?",7,3,33
Tenzin,What brought this on?,7,3,33
Jinora,"I was just talking to Kai, and he was asking me, so-",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Kai! [Kai awkwardly slides behind the airbenders.] What does he know about when you should get tattoos? The answer is ""no""! You're just a little girl.",7,3,33
Jinora,"[Angrily.] I'm not a little girl anymore. I can airbend just as well as you. I know everything about our culture and history, and I have a stronger connection with the spirits that you ever will. [Storms off.] Lead your own class!",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Ikki, Meelo, you're up. Just lead them through the Bagua circle.",7,3,33
Meelo,Look to your left! Look to your right! One of those people will not make it out of here alive.,7,3,33
,"Cut to Jinora, dejectedly looking at a flying bison herd, while Kai walks up to her.",7,3,33
Kai,Sorry what I've said got you into trouble with your dad.,7,3,33
Jinora,It's not your fault. He just can't believe that I'm growing up now and I don't need him telling me what to do like one of his recruits.,7,3,33
Kai,[Smiling.] I know something that'll cheer you up.,7,3,33
,"Jinora and Kai fly to the valley where they found the bison herd, only to find it empty.",7,3,33
Jinora,Where did all the spirits go?,7,3,33
Kai,Where are the babies?,7,3,33
,"Jinora is caught by a fired net. Kai turns and airbends the rustler away. He turns to help Jinora, but is blocked by an earth wall. A rustler fires a net at him. Cut to the rustlers' camp, where they throw Jinora and Kai onto the ground in front of their leader.",7,3,33
Ganbat,What are these kids doing in my camp?,7,3,33
Rustler #1,We caught them sneaking around. Thought they might tell someone we're here.,7,3,33
Ganbat,"They're the new airbenders. Must be living up in the temple. Hurry up and gather the rest of the gang and let's get out of here before someone comes looking for these kids. I'll take them to Ba Sing Se, with the rest of the fresh meat.",7,3,33
,"Jinora and Kai listen to the proposition with fear. Cut to the temple, where Tenzin is meditating.",7,3,33
Tenzin,Tattoos. How could she think? Focus. Breathe. Bumi ruins everything. Inhale. Focus.,7,3,33
Pema,Taking a little break from teaching?,7,3,33
Tenzin,"I've failed. Bumi quit, the rest of the airbenders want to go home. Can't they see that I'm trying to rebuild an entire culture?",7,3,33
Pema,"You know, just because these people can airbend, it doesn't automatically make them Air Nomads.",7,3,33
Tenzin,Tell me about it.,7,3,33
Pema,I remembered when I moved down my parents' house to become an Air Acolyte. That first night I was so scared and lonely and the bed was so hard.,7,3,33
Tenzin,It's actually better for your back. [Pema scowls.] Sorry.,7,3,33
Pema,"The point is: I really wanted to be there, but it still took time for me to adjust to feel like I was a part of it all. The people are probably feeling the same way. You have to be patient.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Now I know how Korra feels when I'm talking to her. [Kisses Pema.] Thank you, Pema.",7,3,33
,"Cut to the outside, where Tenzin sees his brother talking to two airbenders.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Bumi, I want to apologize for losing my patience.",7,3,33
Bumi,[Folds his arms.] I'm not talking to you. [Walks away.],7,3,33
Tenzin,Hey! Get back here. [Sighs; to the airbenders.] Where's Jinora?,7,3,33
Yung,I saw her fly off on her glider with her boyfriend.,7,3,33
Tenzin,[Alarmed.] What? [Narrows his eyes.] Her boyfriend? [Mutters.] Kai!,7,3,33
,"Cut to the rustlers' camp, where Jinora, Kai and the bison calves are locked in cages.",7,3,33
Jinora,How can you steal these bisons? They're endangered.,7,3,33
Ganbat,"Well, that's why they're worth so much. The Earth Queen and her fancy friends pay big money for bison steaks and other rare meats. I even heard she ate her dad's pet bear.",7,3,33
Jinora,You're disgusting. [Ganbat walks off.],7,3,33
Kai,"Hey, do that spirit beaming thing you did to find me. Go to the temple for help.",7,3,33
Jinora,"I can't. I'm all cramped in here and I need quiet and time to focus. But, maybe I can send a message. [Focuses.] Spirits, I need your help. [A spirit appears in front of her.] Go find Bum-Ju, tell him we're in trouble.",7,3,33
,"The spirit flies out of the cage. Cut to the temple, where Bum-Ju chittters to Bumi",7,3,33
Bumi,"No, I don't think I should apologize. Tenzin just wants to boss everybody around. I'm too old for that. [Bum-Ju chitters.] Well, let's face it. I'm just not cut out to be an airbender! [Bum-Ju chitters.] Well, that's your opinion. [Bum-Ju curls up and sleeps. The spirit that Jinora summoned flies next to Bum-Ju and the two spirits converse. Bum-Ju jumps onto Bumi.] Wait, Jinora sent this spirit? Is she in trouble?",7,3,33
,"Bum-Ju and the spirit fly off, while Bumi gives chase. Cut to the airbenders, who are being trained by Meelo.",7,3,33
Bumi,Jinora's in trouble. We have to go get her.,7,3,33
Yung,How do you know?,7,3,33
Bumi,Bum-Ju's friend told me.,7,3,33
Otaku,You're able to communicate with the spirits?,7,3,33
Bumi,"More or less, I get the gist. Let's go.",7,3,33
Daw,Shouldn't Master Tenzin be dealing with this? I don't want to get into trouble,7,3,33
Bumi,"Master Tenzin isn't here. It's up to us. Ikki and Meelo, grab some bison. Airbenders, move out!",7,3,33
,"The airbenders follow the spirit on two flying bison, where they land on a cliffside overlooking the camp. Cut to Bumi spying on the rustlers with a telescope.",7,3,33
Bumi,"Bison rustlers. They've got Kai and Jinora locked in crates. Looks like they're getting ready to leave, we'll have to move fast.",7,3,33
Daw,I don't know if I'm ready to get in a fight with some bison rustlers. I can tell without that telescope that they're mean-looking.,7,3,33
Bumi,"[To the airbenders.] Listen, this is what we've been training for.",7,3,33
Daw,We haven't been training that long.,7,3,33
Bumi,That's not important now. Remembered how we persevered together on that obstacle course?,7,3,33
Otaku,You actually quit.,7,3,33
Bumi,"[Annoyed.] Well, I'm not quitting now. I know we've had a tough time, me more than anyone, but we're airbenders, and there aren't many of us so we've got to stick together. They've got two of our own in cages out there, and we're not leaving until we bring them home.",7,3,33
Meelo,Leave no airbender behind!,7,3,33
,"The rustler closes and locks a cage with a bison calf. As the calves whimper, Kai takes two twigs and picks the lock.",7,3,33
Kai,In. Down. And twist.,7,3,33
,Kai manages to free himself and the calf tumbles free of the cage. He proceeds to free Jinora.,7,3,33
Jinora,Free the bison first.,7,3,33
Bison rustler #2,[Grabs Kai.] Hey! What are you doing out?,7,3,33
,"Kai airbends the rustler away, alerting the other rustlers, who run up to him. Meanwhile, the other airbenders charge into the camp. The rustlers, noticing the airbenders, defend themselves from the air blasts with an earth wall. Kai prepares to attack Ganbat, who is able to detect the attack and knocks Kai away with earthbending. Cut to Daw, who is nearly captured by a net, though he is able to feel the wind coming from the fired net, allowing him to narrowly dodge the attack before counter-attacking. Ganbat splits the airbender group with earthbending, but Meelo is able to leap up the earth wall and knock him off. Two airbenders, riding on Ikki's air scooter, sneak up another rustler and managed to ambush him. Bumi lets out a war cry and the airbenders charge the camp. While Meelo defeats the final rustler, Ganbat enters the truck and drives it away.",7,3,33
Jinora,Kai!,7,3,33
,"Kai grabs his glider and pursues the truck. Cut to Tenzin, riding on Oogi when three adult bison fly past them. Tenzin watches the bison approach a truck.",7,3,33
Tenzin,What's going on down there?,7,3,33
Jinora,Kai! Help!,7,3,33
Tenzin,I'm coming Jinora.,7,3,33
,"Kai catches up and enters the truck, knocking Ganbat down, though he is able to regain control and restrains Kai. The rustler looks in shock as he sees adult bison approaching the truck.",7,3,33
Ganbat,What the ...,7,3,33
,"Tenzin directs Oogi to knock against the truck. Kai leaps off the truck and onto Oogi. An adult bison stops in front of the truck and airbends, stunning Ganbat. Kai leaps off Oogi angrily.",7,3,33
Ganbat,You got me. I give up.,7,3,33
,"Kai aggressively sweeps a gust of air at Ganbat, flinging him against the truck.",7,3,33
Kai,"[Angrily.] You think you can kidnap Jinora, and all these baby bisons?!",7,3,33
,"Kai throws Ganbat upward before slamming him against the truck once more. Before he can attack, Tenzin stops him by grabbing his staff.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"Kai, that's enough! An airbender never attacks a defenseless opponent. [Smiles.] But that was very good technique.",7,3,33
,"Cut to the valley at evening, where the spirits roam about once more. Bumi locks the cage, which contains a sullen Ganbat.",7,3,33
Bumi,"Maybe you boys haven't heard, but there's some new airbenders on these parts. And you never mess with an airbender's bison.",7,3,33
Daw,"[To the other airbenders.] Without my shaved head, I'd never could have dodged that net. I really felt it coming at me. You guys should totally get shaved.",7,3,33
Tenzin,"[To Bumi.] I'm proud of you. Your connection with the spirits, natural leadership, you remind me of Dad.",7,3,33
Bumi,"I'm sorry I've been causing you so much trouble. I guess I was just scared of not being able to measure up as an airbender. You know, even though I'm Aang's son, I never really felt that I was a part of the Air Nation before.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Reassuring him.] You are now.,7,3,33
,"Cut to the bison herd, where Ikki and Meelo are playing with the calves while Jinora and Kai snuggle the mother bison. The mother bison licks Jinora.",7,3,33
Kai,They're so friendly now.,7,3,33
Tenzin,The bison are the original airbenders. They recognize their own kind.,7,3,33
Jinora,[Hugs her father.] I'm sorry for running off.,7,3,33
Tenzin,I'm just lucky no one's hurt.,7,3,33
Jinora,I know.,7,3,33
Tenzin,But I also realized that perhaps I was too harsh on you.,7,3,33
Jinora,Does that mean I can get my airbender tattoos?,7,3,33
Tenzin,It's hard for me to believe that my little girl is grown up enough to have her tattoos. I'll promise I'll think about it. Fair enough?,7,3,33
Jinora,Yeah.,7,3,33
Kai,"Jinora, look. They're flying!",7,3,33
,"The calves awkwardly ascend, bleating and kicking their feet aimlessly.",7,3,33
Tenzin,[Watching the bison calves.] I guess everyone is growing up.,7,3,33
,Fades to credits.,7,3,33
,"The scene opens to Zaofu, where Korra is sparring with Wing. He fires two meteorites at her, but she dodges them and sends her metal cable at him. He dodges it twice, traps it on the ground, and bends it back at her. The impact of the cable knocks Korra to the ground.",8,3,34
Wing,[Fist pumps.] I can't believe I'm sparring with the Avatar! [Camera pans down to his twin brother.],8,3,34
Wei,[Referring to Bolin. Bored and frowning.] I can't believe I'm stuck with her friend.,8,3,34
,Camera angle changes to an aerial view of the practice area and Wing earthbends a trail toward Korra who jumps and dodges. Bolin stands in front of Wei.,8,3,34
Bolin,"Hang on, I think I got it. Let me just try this. [Attempts and fails to bend a meteorite.] Nope, okay maybe- [He is cut off as he gets nailed with a slab of metal by Wei.]",8,3,34
Wei,"Trial by fire. It's the best way to learn metalbending. [Bolin ducks as a meteorite is sent toward him. He quickly bends a pebble at his attacker, directly hitting his forehead.] Agh!",8,3,34
Mako,"[Approaches the scene with Asami.] Whoa. Nice shot, Bolin! [Wei grabs his forehead with both hands and makes little moans of pain.] But I thought you were supposed to be practicing metalbending, not earthbending.",8,3,34
Wei,"[Rubs his red forehead.] Yeah, cheater. [Crosses his arms.]",8,3,34
Bolin,"Mako, metalbending is extremely difficult. No one gets it right away, if they can get it at all! It's not normal! [Cut to Korra, as she is able to dodge Wing's attacks and knock him to the ground with her cables.]",8,3,34
Korra,[Jumps.] Woo-hoo! [Flexes her muscles.] Metalbending champion!,8,3,34
Bolin,Oh sure. She's the Avatar.,8,3,34
Asami,"Guys, it's time to get cleaned up. Tonight is Opal's farewell dinner.",8,3,34
Bolin,"[Sadly.] Oh, now I have to say bye to Opal? This is the worst day ever! [Slumps his shoulders and walks away sulkily.]",8,3,34
,"Cut to Opal's farewell dinner, as the chef walks over and gives Opal her plate.",8,3,34
Opal,Thanks for making my favorite meal.,8,3,34
Chef,"I'm really going to miss you, Opal. No one appreciates my raw veggie wraps like you do. [Walks away to serve the remaining plates of food.]",8,3,34
Bolin,"[To Opal.] Every time I eat raw kale, I'm going to think of you.",8,3,34
Opal,You're so sweet.,8,3,34
Bolin,"This stinks! We were just starting to get to know each other, and now you're off to the Northern Air Temple.",8,3,34
Opal,"We'll be together soon. You guys are coming up after finding more airbenders, right?",8,3,34
Bolin,"Yeah, but that's ... in the future. Ugh, I hate the future!",8,3,34
Opal,"[Holds up a piece of kale, which Bolin bites into.] Until then, we'll always have kale.",8,3,34
Varrick,"[To Bolin.] Kid, can I give you some relationship advice?",8,3,34
Bolin,"[Swallows.] Umm, no.",8,3,34
Varrick,"Well, your loss. [Sits straight in his chair and camera pans further left to reveal Asami next to Varrick.] Zhu Li! [Snaps his fingers.] bring the, uh, thing. [Zhu Li appears in a flash next to Varrick and hands him a contraption from a bag.] Check out my latest invention: [Cut to a close-up of the device with a knob in the center and a red, yellow, and green indicator on top.] an airbender finder. [Camera pans back to the dining table to reveal Korra sitting next to Asami.]",8,3,34
Korra,"[As Asami takes the machine from Varrick. Points her fork at the device.] Wait, that can find airbenders? [Asami points the device toward Korra. Camera switches to Asami's point of view as she moves the device up and down but nothing happens.]",8,3,34
Asami,[Korra looks confused.] Uh ... [Camera pans out to the trio.] I think [Hands the gadget back to Varrick.] it's broken.,8,3,34
Varrick,[Angrily.] It's not broken. She needs to [Waves his hands around in a bending motion.] airbend into it! [Grabs the airbender finder.] How else do you expect the thing to work? [Varrick does not look pleased. Cut to the other side of the dining table where Mako strains to hear the conversation.],8,3,34
Mako,"[From a long way across the table.] What's going on? I can't hear anything. I hate sitting down here! [He grabs his glass and camera pans down to reveal Aiwei watching his outburst. Notices Aiwei next to him, staring at him awkwardly.] Uh, not because of you.",8,3,34
Aiwei,[Dryly.] I can tell you're lying.,8,3,34
,"Mako slumps in his chair and sips his drink with an embarrassed expression, as Suyin taps her glass to get everyone's attention. A metallic object tapping against the glass three times is heard. Camera pans back to the middle of the table again and Suyin has stood up with a glass raised.",8,3,34
Suyin,"Everyone, if I could have your attention please? Tonight, my beautiful little girl leaves for the Northern Air Temple. [Places a hand on her necklace.] Opal, none of us could be more proud of you. You're an incredible daughter, sister, friend, [Lays a hand on her daughter's shoulder.] and soon to be [Suyin bends down a bit and Opal rests against her mother's shoulder.] airbending master. [Suyin gives a kiss on Opal's head. Cut to Huan, Wing, and Wei who watch the slightly emotional scene. The twins sniffle and Huan rolls his eyes. Raises her glass up high.] Here's to Opal. May she help lead us into the new era! [Everyone raises their glass for a toast.]",8,3,34
,Scene fades to the docking bay at sunset and Opal's airship taking off. Cut to Opal standing at the window of the ship and waving goodbye to her family and friends. Camera angle changes to an aerial view of the docking bay where a small crowd is looking up at the airship and some are waving to Opal. Cut to Kuvira behind the group as she pulls out a radio from a metal bag near her hip.,8,3,34
Kuvira,"[Into a walkie-talkie.] Lock it down for the night. [Cut to Korra, Lin, and Bolin. The latter stops waving and looks a little sad.]",8,3,34
Lin,[Gives Korra a smile.] We'll head out first thing in the morning.,8,3,34
,"Bolin sighs solemnly and follows her leave, as Korra walks next to him, with her arm resting on his back in comfort. The duo walks away and the metal petals of the city start to close. Cut to an aerial view of all of Zaofu where all the metal flowers close in harmony. Scene changes to a Zaofu guard patrolling the guest houses at night. Cut to an aerial view of the surrounding parks and the guests houses as various guards walk up and down the perimeter. Below, we can see a small group running across a trail in the park toward a bridge. Cut to Zaheer and his gang quietly peering out from under the bridge. In the background, a guard has a metallic staff in hand and he looks down at the bridge for a few seconds before walking off. Zaheer waves his hand and signals to everyone to continue moving forward. Cut to another guard patrolling the sheltered walkway as the bad guys use the cover of darkness to sneak past the walkway undetected. They head toward a guest house in the far end. Cut to Bolin in his pajamas with a blanket over him in his bed, snoring. Pabu is curled up on top of the blanket and the fire ferret perks up with a squeak.",8,3,34
Bolin,"[Mumbling.] Kale, kale, kale ... Opal ...",8,3,34
,"Pabu wakes up. The fire ferret leaps off the bed and hops over to the nearby window sill and looks out, noticing the four criminals. He paws against the glass and squeaks loudly in alarm in an attempt to wake his owner jolting Bolin awake.",8,3,34
Bolin,"What? [His pet continues to shrill.] What's going on? [He sinks back and lays down to his pillow in annoyance.] Pabu, sleep!",8,3,34
,"Back outside the window, P'Li and Ghazan ducks down an alley between two guest houses while Zaheer and Ming-Hua hide under a window. Zaheer directs his gang onward to the adjacent bedroom window: Korra's. They crouch down beside it, and Ming-Hua raises a water tentacle up and forms a small sickle at the end. She uses the ice sickle to scratch the glass and carves a hole into the window with water bending. Cut to the inside of the room that Ming-Hua is attempting to break into and we see Naga sleeping in front of the bed. Camera pans right to Korra in her pajamas, deeply asleep. Camera returns back to the sickle on the window as it makes a complete circle. Water encases the cut glass and it pulls away quietly off-screen. Another water tentacle arm holding three red darts is soon raised. Naga awakens and growls, but she is quickly knocked out by shirshu-spit darts. Korra wakes up to the sound of her whimpering, as Zaheer bends a blast of air into the window. She avoids it and jumps out of her bed, attempting to firebend, but she is hit by a dart as she lands. Ghazan and P'Li enter and pick her up as she loses consciousness. Back to Bolin's room, as Pabu leaps onto the bed to get his owner's full attention.",8,3,34
Bolin,"[As Pabu chatters.] Huh? What? Oh, Pabu. [As the fire ferret jumps back to the window.] It's not play time right now. Okay, we are seriously going to have to have a talk- [Sees an unconscious Korra being held by the fleeing fugitives.] What the heck?! They've got Korra. They've got Korra! [Mako wakes up in the other bed and they quickly exit their room.]",8,3,34
Mako,"[Blasts fire at the gang.] Let her go! [Bolin sends at a boulder shortly after Mako's attack, but P'Li absorbs the fire, while Ming-Hua stops the boulder with waterbending. She sends a line of water at the brothers, but Mako counters it with more firebending. P'Li and Zaheer attack, which Mako and Bolin also avoid. They hide behind a pillar. Mako yells to the guards at the top towers.] They've got Korra!",8,3,34
,"An alarm begin to blare loudly, and two guards activate the spotlights and direct their beam down on the criminals.",8,3,34
Ming-Hua,So much for the element of surprise.,8,3,34
Ghazan,Back-up plan.,8,3,34
,"P'Li turns and fires a blast at each spotlight before curving a third around the pillar Mako and Bolin are using for cover, sending them flying to land outside Asami's door. She runs out to help them.",8,3,34
Mako,We can't let them take her.,8,3,34
Asami,I don't think they're going to get far. Look!,8,3,34
,"One of Zaofu's guards attacks the group, but is easily overpowered. The criminals try to flee, but are stopped in their tracks as they are surrounded with slabs of metal, bent by Lin Beifong. Wei and Wing add onto the pile, backed up by Kuvira and more guards.",8,3,34
Kuvira,We have you surrounded. It's over. Release the Avatar!,8,3,34
,"Lava begins to flow out from underneath the pile, evidently bent by Ghazan. Lin uses a rock pillar to propel herself away from the deadly lava, and Kuvira and another guard do the same with their metal cables. The metal cage holding the criminals slowly falls apart under the magma.",8,3,34
Bolin,No way! That guy is lavabending! That's awesome ... ly not good for us.,8,3,34
,"The Beifong estate courtyard has become a battleground. The Metal Clan and Team Avatar are pinned down by P'Li while Ghazan and Ming-Hua protect her from retaliatory attacks. Cut to the point of view of Korra, who has regained consciousness but is still paralyzed.",8,3,34
Zaheer,I'm going to create some cover. We've got to get out of here!,8,3,34
,"He begins to airbend a mask of smoke from Ghazan's lava but is caught by the wrist by a cable of one of the guards, who is able to reel Zaheer off the platform. Ghazan sends a lava bomb at the guard who breaks cover to go after Zaheer, but it is blocked by another guard with a metal slab. Bolin, Mako, Lin, and Asami take cover together behind a slab of metal in order to avoid the criminals' attacks, firing off some of their own. P'Li notices them and arcs a combustion blast to hit them, but it is blocked just short of connecting by another metal slab bent by Suyin and her twin sons, who join them.",8,3,34
Lin,[To Suyin.] How did they get in here? [Everyone ducks reflexively as a combustion attack detonates nearby.],8,3,34
Suyin,"I don't know, but we're not letting them escape!",8,3,34
,"They look over, as three guards use more metal slabs to create a bridge to get to the criminals. Ghazan knocks the guards off with earthbending.",8,3,34
Asami,There's no way to cross that moat.,8,3,34
Suyin,[Looks up at the ceiling dome.] We don't need to cross it. Lin and I can drop in from the dome on cables.,8,3,34
Lin,[Sarcastically.] That's a great idea. Except we'll get blown up the second that third-eyed freak sees us. [Another blast explodes as if to prove her point.],8,3,34
Suyin,"She's a combustionbender. If one of you can stun her, her powers will be knocked out temporarily.",8,3,34
Mako,Bolin can land a shot.,8,3,34
Bolin,I can?,8,3,34
Suyin,You have to take her out right before we drop down.,8,3,34
Bolin,I do?,8,3,34
,Cut to the top of the dome.,8,3,34
Wing,Open the hatch. [It opens to reveal them standing directly above the battlezone.],8,3,34
Suyin,"If we get in trouble, metalbend us up.",8,3,34
Wing,[Into a walkie-talkie.] We're in position.,8,3,34
Mako,Copy that. It's Bolin time.,8,3,34
Bolin,"All right. Bolin time. Bolin time! [Bolin fires a boulder at P'Li, but she ducks and avoids it. The criminals immediately start firing attacks toward Mako, Bolin, and Asami's slab. Attacks go back and forth.] I can't get a clean shot!",8,3,34
Mako,You have to!,8,3,34
Wing,[From his walkie-talkie.] Are we a go?,8,3,34
Mako,No go!,8,3,34
Wing,"Copy that, we're a go.",8,3,34
Mako,"I said no! Wait! [He is too late. Suyin and Lin drop down. Mako peers back at the criminals, who are preoccupied with the guards. P'Li looks up and sees Suyin and Lin.] Bolin, take the shot!",8,3,34
,"P'Li grins and gets ready to fire as Bolin gets up and quickly launches a tiny pebble at her. The pebble hits her dead-centre in her third-eye tattoo, knocks her head back, and causes her attack to explode right above her team. The explosion knocks the criminals down. Cut to Mako who cheers on the success of Bolin's attack, which allowed Suyin and Lin to land safely.",8,3,34
Mako,"Haha, nice job, little bro!",8,3,34
,"Lin picks up Korra and travels with her sister back up toward the dome. Ming-Hua traps her leg with water, but Mako blasts fire at her to break her hold and divert her attention. Meanwhile, Zaheer is busy fighting two guards, but looks up and sees Lin escaping with Korra.",8,3,34
Zaheer,No!,8,3,34
,"Zaheer flies up on his glider in pursuit of Lin. He blasts air at the chief, but she manages to avoid it. Just as Zaheer is about to reach her, Suyin swings Lin out of the way and metalbends the metal shards that make up her necklace at the glider, piercing its wings, and sending Zaheer spiraling down. Cut to a frontal shot of the sisters as they continue their ascend.",8,3,34
Lin,Thanks.,8,3,34
,"Switch back to an overhead shot of Zaheer's descend. As he nears the his companions, he folds his gliders and lands safely next to his team using his airbending.",8,3,34
Zaheer,We've failed!,8,3,34
,"Zaheer angrily airbends a huge cloud of smoke; when it clears, the lava has cooled, and there is no sign of them. Cut to the top of the dome.",8,3,34
Lin,Where did they go?,8,3,34
Suyin,"They can't be far! [Into a walkie-talkie.] Guards, search the entire estate!",8,3,34
,"Cut to Suyin's office, where Korra lies on the couch, waking up.",8,3,34
Aiwei,[Voice-over.] This should neutralize [His hand slides under Korra's head and a green bottle is placed at her lips.] the shirshu toxins.,8,3,34
,"Aiwei tilts the bottle so some of the liquid flows into Korra's mouth. Cut to a side-view of Korra's hand as it slowly twitches and she lifts a finger. Cut to a wider view of the Beifong sisters looking down on the Avatar. Suyin rests her right hand on her chest in relief, though Lin angrily turns to her half-sister, her fists clenched to her sides.",8,3,34
Lin,[To Suyin.] How could you let this happen?! [Korra brings a knee up.] You assured me this was one of the most [Korra tries to sit up.] secure places in the world.,8,3,34
Suyin,"It is. I don't know how this happened. Obviously this was a well-planned operation, so [Frowns at Lin.] don't blame me.",8,3,34
Kuvira,We searched the entire estate. There's no sign of them.,8,3,34
Lin,"Well, keep looking! [Kuvira gives a bow and departs. Aiwei stands up.]",8,3,34
Aiwei,It would seem they had some inside knowledge of Zaofu. They must've been working with someone.,8,3,34
Korra,[Sighs.] The- [Puts a hand on her head and sits up.] the guards. It had to be one of them.,8,3,34
Aiwei,I agree.,8,3,34
Suyin,Question them all! Whoever betrayed my city will suffer the consequences!,8,3,34
,"Suyin storms off and view changes to the open petal city at day time. Cut to an interrogation room, as Aiwei is seated at one end of a small table, with a guard at the next. Shot gradually shifts as Aiwei asks each question, indicating an elapse of time.",8,3,34
Aiwei,What is your full name? [Camera fades to a close-up of Aiwei as he questions a second guard.] Where were you last night? [Camera fades again to another shot of Aiwei questioning yet a different guard.] Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar? [Camera fades to a young male guard.],8,3,34
Zhu Guan,My name is Zhu Guan.,8,3,34
Second guard,[Shot gradually shifts to an older male guard.] I was patrolling the south wall of the Beifong estates.,8,3,34
Third guard,[Shot shifts to another younger guard.] I have absolutely no knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap Korra.,8,3,34
,"Aiwei looks back at Lin and shakes his head, signaling that this man is not the culprit. Korra looks at Lin defeatedly and Lin nods to Aiwei to question the next suspect. Cut to a view of Varrick's hands on the table.",8,3,34
Varrick,"What was I doing last night? [Camera pans to Varrick's face.] Same thing I always do. From nine to ten, I checked my body for ticks. Lyme disease is a serious killer. [Cut to everyone else in the room looking at him with disbelief.] Then I did my nightly [View changes to Varrick standing up with a leg on a chair and exercising while demonstrating the workout.] Varrick calisthenics, followed by [Stops exercising.] thirty minutes of breath holding. I filmed the whole thing if you want to watch it.",8,3,34
,Cut to Aiwei with a hand on his head. Korra has a hand on her mouth and she looks like she is about to laugh. Mako pinches his nose bridge from annoyance. Suyin has two hands clasped in front of her mouth.,8,3,34
Aiwei,That won't be necessary.,8,3,34
,Varrick and his assistant leave the interrogation room and close the door behind them.,8,3,34
Lin,"Maybe it wasn't a guard after all. Maybe it was someone a little higher up the food chain. Aiwei, why don't you question Su?",8,3,34
Korra,"Lin, stop! Your sister was not involved!",8,3,34
Suyin,"No, [Walks over to the chair.] I'll gladly be questioned. I have nothing to hide. [Sits down.]",8,3,34
Aiwei,"[Looks to the side, a little reluctantly.] What is your full name?",8,3,34
Suyin,"Suyin Beifong. I'm the daughter of Toph and [Glances at Lin.] the only sister to Lin, and I had nothing to do with the attack last night.",8,3,34
Aiwei,[Turns to Lin.] She is telling [Korra sighs with frustration in the background.] the truth.,8,3,34
Korra,This is a waste of time! Just bring in the next guard!,8,3,34
,The next guard walks in and sits down.,8,3,34
Aiwei,Give me your name and tell me where you are from.,8,3,34
Hong Li,I'm Hong Li. I was born and raised here in Zaofu.,8,3,34
Aiwei,Do you have any knowledge of the people who tried to kidnap the Avatar?,8,3,34
Hong Li,No.,8,3,34
Aiwei,[Stiffens and leans forward.] Did you help the attackers enter Zaofu last night?,8,3,34
Hong Li,"No, of course not.",8,3,34
Aiwei,[Calmly.] You're lying.,8,3,34
Hong Li,"[Shocked.] What?! No, I'm not! [Suyin walks and storms up to him.]",8,3,34
Suyin,How did they get in and out? [Grabs him by the armor and pulls him out of the chair and slams him against the wall.] Where are they now?,8,3,34
Hong Li,"[Fearful.] I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't help them!",8,3,34
Suyin,You're a traitor to the entire clan!,8,3,34
Aiwei,I suggest we search his place.,8,3,34
,"Hong Li's eyes widen and quiver with fright. Cut to an apartment complex which is Hong Li's house, as they search for evidence. Cut to the inside of an apartment with Team Avatar and Aiwei searching for clues. Bolin walks to the kitchen and opens the oven before closing it in disappointment. He stands up and opens a small cupboard above. Cut to Mako's hands separating some papers on a desk and he picks up a small written note.",8,3,34
Mako,I got something!,8,3,34
Bolin,[Mouth stuffed with cookies.] What? [Bolin puts away the cookie jar and starts to eat. Everyone walks over to Mako.],8,3,34
Mako,"[Reading the note.] It looks like it's from them. [Cut to a close-up of the writing on the note.] ""Team assembled. Ready to rendezvous.""",8,3,34
Asami,[Hands Aiwei a book.] And look at this.,8,3,34
Aiwei,[Takes the book and opens it as Mako leans over to look.] These are the guards' logbooks. All their schedules and routes are in here.,8,3,34
Korra,That guard knows everything. [Closes the book.] We have to get him to talk.,8,3,34
Mako,Let's go confront him with this evidence right now.,8,3,34
Aiwei,No. [The teens are confused.] Let's give him a little time to sweat it out. He will talk eventually.,8,3,34
,"Aiwei walks away. Cut to Mako who forms a slightly suspicious look on his face as he watches the truth seer leave. Location changes to an overhead view of Team Avatar checking out the cooled down moat from last night. Naga is walking around, sniffing the rocks. A few Zaofu guards watch over the crime scene.",8,3,34
Mako,"I don't understand why we're not talking to that guard right now. [Camera changes to a close-up of team on ground.] Every minute we waste here, those guys get further away. I mean, how does a random guard get involved with a group of super criminals anyway?",8,3,34
Asami,What do you mean?,8,3,34
Mako,That guard is only eighteen years old and has lived in Zaofu his entire life. Zaheer and his gang have been in prison for more than thirteen years.,8,3,34
Korra,"I don't know, but we all saw the evidence. It's pretty overwhelming.",8,3,34
Varrick,"[Pops up from inside a hole, surprising the gang.] Maybe a little too overwhelming?",8,3,34
Bolin,"Hey, Varrick. What are you doing here?",8,3,34
Varrick,"Collecting pumice stones with Zhu Li. That lavabender did a lot of damage, but he makes a nice exfoliating rock, and when you got callouses like mine, you take all the pumice stones you can get your hands on. Or in my case, feet.",8,3,34
,"Varrick laughs, as Zhu Li rubs a stone against his foot, to Team Avatar's disgust.",8,3,34
Mako,What were you saying about the evidence?,8,3,34
Varrick,"I was saying that I can smell a conspiracy when I see one. Look, if I was trying to set someone up, I would tell everyone he's guilty and then plant the evidence in his apartment as proof.",8,3,34
Mako,"Oh, you mean exactly like what you did to me?",8,3,34
Varrick,"Yes, just like that! Remember how great that worked? Well, not for you.",8,3,34
Mako,"You're right. All the evidence points to this guard, but maybe he's just the fallback.",8,3,34
Bolin,But for who?,8,3,34
Mako,For the only person who can truly keep a secret in this city: Aiwei.,8,3,34
,"Cut to Team Avatar, outside Aiwei's house. Bolin peeks into the window.",8,3,34
Bolin,He's not home. Or he's hiding in there. [Gasps.] Or he's invisible. [Mako looks at him very skeptically.] Probably just not home.,8,3,34
Mako,"We have to get in there and find some evidence that links Aiwei to Zaheer, otherwise Su won't believe us. [Team Avatar walks in and begins to search. Asami flips through a book on a table.]",8,3,34
Asami,It's just an empty book. [Bolin gains interest in a jar on Aiwei's bookshelf.],8,3,34
Bolin,"Hmm, it's like a desert on a jar.",8,3,34
Mako,"Bolin, put that back! We don't want Aiwei to know we were in here if we can't find anything. [Bolin moves to put the jar back, but has forgotten where it was.] You forgot where it goes, didn't you? [Mako puts the jar back on its shelf a few inches from where it originally was. He moves onto the end of the bookshelf, as he sees some marks on the floor.] These look like scuff marks. I think this bookshelf slides open. [He slides the shelf aside to reveal a cellar.]",8,3,34
Korra,What do you think is down there?,8,3,34
Bolin,Could be a storage cellar.,8,3,34
Mako,Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.,8,3,34
Asami,Aiwei's coming back! Quick.,8,3,34
,"The trio run off of the stairs and slide the bookshelf back where it was, as Aiwei enters.",8,3,34
Aiwei,What are doing in my house? You are trespassing on the property of one of the highest-ranked officials in the city. You'd better have a good explanation.,8,3,34
Bolin,"We do. We do. We actually knocked on your front door and we thought we heard you say, [In a higher pitched voice.] 'Come in, I'm in the bathroom!' [Silence as Bolin changes back to his normal voice.] I don't even know why I'm saying that. You know I'm lying, and you don't even sound like that.",8,3,34
Korra,"We came here because things weren't adding up, and we thought you might have some answers.",8,3,34
Aiwei,"[Gestures to his couch.] Sit. If you want to talk, let's talk over some tea. [Pours green tea into a cup.] Now, what is not adding up exactly? Hong Li was clearly lying and we found evidence in his apartment.",8,3,34
Mako,But don't you think it's weird how young he is? How did he ever get mixed up with this group?,8,3,34
Aiwei,"[Walks toward the bookshelf.] Perhaps through a relative, or maybe he was bribed. We will find out those answers in time. But if wasn't him, who do you think it was?",8,3,34
Asami,We don't know.,8,3,34
Aiwei,"[Moves the jar back to its original spot.] You don't think I had something to do with this, do you?",8,3,34
Korra,We're just looking for answers.,8,3,34
Aiwei,"And you think you've found something, don't you? [Notices the bookshelf has been moved. Pauses as Team Avatar looks at each other nervously.] You have no idea what is coming for you, Avatar.",8,3,34
,"Aiwei metalbends his stairs upward. Mako firebends at the new wall, but it has no effect. Korra metalbends into the wall, but only makes a small rupture.",8,3,34
Mako,"Come on, he's getting away!",8,3,34
Korra,"I'm still a little new at this, so back off! [Korra manages to break through the wall, and the gang run to the cellar and open the door, only to find a bomb, which promptly goes off, but Korra airbends to protect herself and her allies from the impact.] Ugh!",8,3,34
Mako,He's gone.,8,3,34
Korra,"[Sees a small opening nearly covered by debris.] Look, he must've escaped through there! Help me clear it out.",8,3,34
,"Bolin and Korra do so with earthbending to reveal a tunnel entrance, as Lin and Suyin run into the room.",8,3,34
Lin,What happened? We heard an explosion.,8,3,34
Suyin,Where's Aiwei?,8,3,34
Korra,Your trusted adviser is the one who betrayed us. He was lying about the guard.,8,3,34
Suyin,What? No!,8,3,34
Korra,We confronted him and he bolted through here.,8,3,34
,Lin uses seismic sense on the tunnel.,8,3,34
Lin,He must have collapsed the tunnel behind him.,8,3,34
Mako,And he rigged an explosion to destroy any evidence that might have been here.,8,3,34
Korra,This is where Zaheer got in and out. Aiwei was the traitor.,8,3,34
Suyin,[Saddened.] I ... trusted him.,8,3,34
Kuvira,[Runs in.] Is everyone okay?,8,3,34
Lin,"Aiwei is a fugitive. Get all available guards to search the mountainside, and find out where this tunnel exits immediately!",8,3,34
,"Kuvira obeys, and Lin walks over to comfort her sister. Cut back to Suyin's office, where the Beifong sisters and Team Avatar are sitting. Kuvira runs to the door.",8,3,34
Lin,What did you find?,8,3,34
Kuvira,"We located the end of the tunnel, but there's no sign of him. Just some fresh tire tracks. [Leaves.]",8,3,34
Mako,He had an escape plan all ready to go.,8,3,34
Suyin,"I trusted him with my life. I thought we were family, but it was all a lie.",8,3,34
Mako,"Whoever these guys are, they're more powerful than we thought, and more dangerous.",8,3,34
Korra,That's why we have to find them. We're going to hold off our search for airbenders and hunt down Aiwei. Naga can track his scent.,8,3,34
Asami,"And I bet if we find Aiwei, we'll find Zaheer.",8,3,34
Lin,"No! We're not hunting this group. There could be other secret agents in other parts of the world looking for you right now! I'm taking you back to Republic City, where I can protect you.",8,3,34
Korra,"If I wasn't safe here, then I'm not safe anywhere. I have to stop them!",8,3,34
Lin,It's too dangerous! You are not going!,8,3,34
Korra,Stop trying to protect me! I'm the Avatar. This is my job!,8,3,34
Lin,Don't lecture me about jobs!,8,3,34
Suyin,"Enough! Korra, listen to Lin.",8,3,34
Korra,But ... they ...,8,3,34
Suyin,"Please. Lin's only looking out for you. I promise you, Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.",8,3,34
Korra,"Fine, if you really think it's best.",8,3,34
Suyin,I do.,8,3,34
Lin,"Thank you, Su.",8,3,34
Suyin,Everyone should get some rest tonight. I'll have my people prep your airship and you can leave first thing in the morning.,8,3,34
,Cut to Team Avatar's apartment. There's a knock at the door. Korra opens it to find Suyin.,8,3,34
Korra,Su.,8,3,34
Suyin,You really think Naga could track Aiwei?,8,3,34
Korra,Definitely.,8,3,34
Suyin,"Then, here. [Hands Korra keys.] There's a jeep packed with supplies on the east gate. It's all gassed up and ready to go.",8,3,34
Korra,What? Why?,8,3,34
Suyin,Because I want you to hunt down Aiwei and bring him back to me.,8,3,34
Bolin,But you said -,8,3,34
Suyin,I said what Lin wanted to hear and I bought you guys some time. Go. I'll deal with Lin in the morning.,8,3,34
Korra,Let's get this guy! [Hugs Suyin.] Thanks.,8,3,34
,"Cut to Korra, riding on Naga, with the rest of Team Avatar in the jeep behind her. Cut to credits.",8,3,34
,"The scene opens to a few rocks dotting the desert landscape and we can see some spirits casually mingling about. In the background, Team Avatar has arrived in a local Earth Kingdom desert village with hopes to track down Aiwei. Naga is seen stopping to sniff the ground. Cut to a close-up of the group as Asami pulls in the jeep behind Korra.",9,3,35
Korra,"Aiwei has definitely been through here. [To Naga.] Nice tracking, girl.",9,3,35
Mako,Let's ask around. Maybe someone's seen him.,9,3,35
,Cut to the inside of a tavern as Mako pushes the curtain aside at the entrance. The group enters and everyone in the tavern glances at the group. Bolin notices something on the wall of the tavern and the camera pans to reveal a wanted poster of him on the wall.,9,3,35
Bolin,"[Spots a poster with his face on it.] Ohh look, they have a mover poster of me. [Mako looks at the poster with mild surprise.] Must be big Nuktuk fans, [Rubs hands together.] yeah, [He starts to walk forward.] I should go out and say hello ...",9,3,35
Mako,"[Mako grabs Bolin by his sleeve.] No. Those are wanted posters, [Scene pulls back to reveal wanted posters for all four teens on the wall. Mako reads Korra's poster.] and there's one for each of us. ""Wanted by Her Majesty, the Earth Queen, for crimes against the Kingdom."" [Cut to Mako as he raises an eyebrow while Korra is fuming behind him. Glances back at Korra, rolling his eyes.] I'm guessing this is because we took her airbenders.",9,3,35
Korra,"[Frustrated.] They weren't hers to keep! I swear, if I see her pinchy [Asami glances back into the tavern.] little queen face again, I am going to ...",9,3,35
Asami,"[Interrupts with alarm.] Uhh, guys ... [Camera pans across the various patrons of the bar and one man pulls out his sword while another shows off his spear.] We should get out of here.",9,3,35
,The group walks out and Korra does a gesture to all the men in the tavern before she departs. The scene shifts to an aerial view of the Beifong Estate in the morning with the remnants of the battle lingering in the shot. View switches to Suyin talking to two guards on the bridge where Lin walks toward and confronts her sister.,9,3,35
Lin,Where's everyone? I've been waiting to leave for half an hour.,9,3,35
Suyin,"And good morning to you, Lin. Now don't get mad, Korra's fine. I'm just waiting to hear if she'd tracked down Aiwei yet.",9,3,35
Lin,"[Alarmed. Furrows her brows.] What! You let Korra go?! I thought we were on the same page about this, and then you go and stab me in the back?",9,3,35
Suyin,"Oh, don't be so overdramatic. You can't control the Avatar's every move.",9,3,35
Lin,[Walks off angrily.] I can try.,9,3,35
,The scene shifts to Naga running with Korra on her back and the rest of the group following a windy road. Camera pans out to an aerial view of Team Avatar making their way down a path on the road. The jeep follows closely and Naga runs up a small slope. View switches to Naga sniffing the ground for any scent near a bunch of rocks.,9,3,35
Korra,"Naga found something. [Korra gets off her mount and Naga sits. The Avatar earthbends a giant boulder to the side to find Aiwei's jeep hidden behind a small clearing. Naga bumps her head on and nudges Korra and awaits a reward.] Oh ... Sorry, I forgot to bring treats [Naga whines and bends down as Korra affectionately rubs the polar bear dog's face.] but, good girl.",9,3,35
,"Naga responds by whining once more and turn to walk away. Her tail whips and slaps Korra in the face, causing her to groan. Asami and the brothers walk up to the vehicle in the background. Korra hunches her shoulder's from Naga's cold shoulder attitude.",9,3,35
Asami,[Walking toward the jeep.] This must be Aiwei's jeep. He can't be far.,9,3,35
Mako,"[Looking at the Misty Palms Oasis and walking to the edge of the slope.] Bolin and I [Cut to a view of a town nearby in the background.] will investigate the Misty Palms Oasis, and see if he's hold up there.",9,3,35
Bolin,Yes! [Folds arms.] I love it when you talk like a cop.,9,3,35
Korra,I'm coming too.,9,3,35
Mako,"No. You and Asami wait here in case he comes back. Besides, we don't want to call too much attention to ourselves.",9,3,35
Korra,[Reluctantly.] All right.,9,3,35
Bolin,"[Excitedly.] Ooh, Mako, Mako, Mako! We should wear disguises and pretend we're going undercover! That way, [Places a hand over his mouth and the other on his forehead.] no one will recognize us. Haha, police work is so exciting!",9,3,35
,"Scene changes to a hand unzipping a bag of supplies. Camera pans out to a back view of Bolin as he pulls out a bright yellow raincoat and drapes it over his head and body. Cut to his eyes as bright green goggles are worn. Camera pans out to the brothers dressed in identical outfits. Cut to Korra and Asami looking askance and unconvinced at them, as if questioning the effectiveness of their disguises.",9,3,35
Bolin,"[Off-screen.] All right, now we need our undercover identities! [Camera focuses on Bolin now as he regales a sad story.] I'm an ex-United Forces operative named Ting-Ting. War was the only woman I ever loved, until Ivy came along and showed me what real love is. Tragically, she was taken from me by my archenemy Dr. Razor and -",9,3,35
Mako,[Interrupts.] Enough! [Starts walking.] Let's just find Aiwei.,9,3,35
Bolin,But I haven't even told your backstory.,9,3,35
Mako,[Heads to the city.] I'm a cop. I don't have a backstory.,9,3,35
Bolin,[Catches up to his brother.] Uh! You're good at this. [Chasing Mako.],9,3,35
,"The scene fades to the expanded Misty Palms Oasis' entrance, with Mako and Bolin stepping forward. View changes to the spirits lurking and perched on the rooftop and telephone lines of the town, looking down at the two yellow-coated guys. Cut to a close-up of the brothers as they make their way down the street. View focuses on the center of the city, where there is an ice spring with three spirits lounging on it. Mako and Bolin pause and stop near the ice. They watch a guy sweeping and pushing three kiwi bird-like spirits outside the door with a broom.",9,3,35
Tavern owner,Shoo! Human customers only.,9,3,35
,The spirits scurry off. The brothers walk up to the tavern owner sweeping his stoop.,9,3,35
Mako,"Let's see if this guy knows anything. [Heads to the tavern.] Excuse me, sir? We're looking for a man about sixty, balding, wearing glasses in a long green robe.",9,3,35
Bolin,And he's got this weird piercing that goes from his nose [Points to his nose.] to his [Points to his ear.] ear. Freaks me out.,9,3,35
Tavern owner,"Yeah, sure. Sounds like a guy who came in last night. I told him I had the best drinks in the Earth Kingdom and he called me a liar.",9,3,35
Mako,[Excitedly. Smiles hopefully.] That's him! Any idea where he is now?,9,3,35
Tavern owner,"[Sadly.] Nah, afraid not. But he was right. [His posture looks defeated.] My drinks are terrible. [Walks inside dejectedly into his bar while the brothers look on in shock.]",9,3,35
,Cut to Korra sitting on a boulder near the city. View changes to a frontal shot of Korra with Asami in the background glancing at her friend as she observing Aiwei's jeep.,9,3,35
Asami,Are you okay?,9,3,35
Korra,[Sighs.] I'm just frustrated. What does Zaheer want with me? What's his plan?,9,3,35
,Asami slides up the driver's seat as she reaches for something in the glove compartment. Cut to a close-up of her as she pulls out a note.,9,3,35
Asami,I don't know. But I think I found a clue. [Picks up the paper and lends it to Korra.],9,3,35
Korra,"[Reads the letter.] Xai Bau's Grove, sundown. This must be where and when Aiwei's going to meet Zaheer!",9,3,35
Asami,"[Looks at Earth Kingdom map.] All right. Xai Bau's Grove, where are you? [Suddenly a blue-colored spirit stands on the map, screeching.] Go away! I'm trying to find something.",9,3,35
Bolin,"[Cuts to the city, where Bolin is waiting near the door of an establishment. A purplish spirit rises from a nearby urn.] Well, aren't you a cute little spir- [The spirit bites Bolin's finger.] Ow! Hey! [A couple recognizes Bolin.]",9,3,35
Mako,[Heads from the door.] No luck here.,9,3,35
Bolin,[Stage-whisper.] I think there might be a couple bounty hunters over there who recognize me!,9,3,35
Mako,We've been made. Let's lose 'em!,9,3,35
,"The boys flee down a street, the couple close on their heels. They finally duck down an alley, hiding behind some boxes and barely escaping the notice of the female pursuer. The couple moves on as the brothers peek out of hiding.",9,3,35
Mako,"Okay, I think we're clear. We should head back to Korra before someone else recognizes us.",9,3,35
,Aiwei strolls nonchalantly past the other end of the alley. Bolin spots him and yanks Mako back out of view.,9,3,35
Bolin,"We could, or ... we could follow Aiwei instead. [Points.] Look!",9,3,35
,"Aiwei strolls down an alley, eating food from a box. Mako and Bolin appear from behind, and spy on him.",9,3,35
Mako,All right. [Puts on glasses and starts walking.] Stay cool and follow my lead.,9,3,35
Bolin,[Starts to follow.] Ting-Ting always finds his man.,9,3,35
,Mako and Bolin follow Aiwei down a street and past a pink building. They watch as Aiwei enters a room and closes the door.,9,3,35
Mako,Keep an eye on him. I'll go get Korra.,9,3,35
,Scene shifts back to Korra and Asami observing the map. Mako pulls off his disguise and walks to them.,9,3,35
Mako,We found Aiwei hiding in an inn.,9,3,35
Korra,That's great!,9,3,35
Asami,We found something too. [Hands Mako the letter.] It looks like he's gonna meet Zaheer at sundown at a place called Xai Bau's Grove. But I can't find it anywhere on the map.,9,3,35
Korra,Let's go bust down Aiwei's door and finally get some answers.,9,3,35
Mako,"No. Once Aiwei knows we're onto him, we lose our advantage. I say we stake out his room and when he leaves for this meeting, we follow him.",9,3,35
Korra,[Cut to Korra who looks serious.] And he'll lead us straight to Zaheer.,9,3,35
,"The scene shifts to the Misty Palms Inn, as Team Avatar try to get a room.",9,3,35
Mako,"[To the innkeeper.] Good afternoon. We'd like a room on the ground floor, across from 102, please.",9,3,35
Innkeeper,"Forget it! Last time a bunch of teenagers came in here, they trashed the whole room. [Mako frowns and the stalkers from earlier stop at the inn's entrance.]",9,3,35
Macao,[At the entrance.] We found you! [The team turns around in alarm and get into fighting poses. Mako lights up a ball of fire above his palm and Korra bends fire daggers in both hands. Team Avatar gets ready to fight.],9,3,35
Innkeeper,"Hey, no bending in here! Take it outside!",9,3,35
Macao,"[Places both hands out to appease the team.] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not here to fight you. [A goofy smile appears on the couple's faces.] We're here to meet Nuktuk!",9,3,35
Lily,[Walks up to Bolin and pulls out a poster for him to sign.] We're your biggest fans. Can you make it out to Lily and Macao?,9,3,35
Bolin,"Uh, I'd be happy to. Always love meeting my fans. [Signs the poster.]",9,3,35
Lily,[Pulls out a doll that looks like Bolin. Holds it up to him and squeaks it.] I made this Nuktuk doll for you.,9,3,35
Bolin,"[Starts to smile.] Uh, it's ... cute. [Bolin grins as Lily squeaks the doll in a sound of agreement.]",9,3,35
Innkeeper,Why didn't you tell me your friend was a mover star? I'd be happy to rent you any room in the inn.,9,3,35
Mako,We'll just take the one across from 102.,9,3,35
Innkeeper,But that room is too small for the four of you!,9,3,35
Mako,"Trust me, it'll be perfect.",9,3,35
,"Scene shifts to Team Avatar, squished in their new room.",9,3,35
Bolin,"I'd just like to say, for the record, this room is definitely not perfect. [Naga's tail hits him in the face.] Naga! [Mako and Korra look out the window, and see Aiwei peeking out of his across for them.]",9,3,35
Korra,There he is.,9,3,35
Bolin,"I thought stakeouts were supposed to be exciting. This isn't. At all! [Looks in the highest bedside table drawer.] Ooh, I wonder if there's any snacks in here. [There are no snacks, so Bolin keeps look in the other drawers and finds a Pai Sho board.] Hey, look! A Pai Sho board! Mako, you want to play?",9,3,35
Mako,"Kind of busy here, bro.",9,3,35
Asami,I'll play.,9,3,35
Bolin,"Oh, well, ugh, no offense but I learned street Pai Sho from Shady Shin, and I'm pretty good. So, wouldn't really be a fair game.",9,3,35
Asami,"So? I learned to play from my dad, the diabolical genius. I'll destroy you.",9,3,35
Bolin,"Well, looks we've got ourselves a Pai-Shodown. [They set up their boards.] Ladies first. [They exchange a couple moves, but Asami stops and thinks on one of her turns.] Uh, I don't mean to rush you, but let's speed things up a bit.",9,3,35
Asami,"Why? This game is all about slow, methodical strategy.",9,3,35
Bolin,"No, it's not. This is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, game of chance! Don't think. Just go.",9,3,35
Asami,"I don't know what Shady Shin taught you, but it wasn't the real Pai Sho.",9,3,35
Bolin,"Oh really? I think Mr. Rulebook might disagree with you. [Reads from the rulebook.] The origins of Pai Sho date back over ten thousand years. It is a game of both strategy and chance. Wait, how can it be both?",9,3,35
Asami,Let me see that. [Takes the book and starts reading from it.] There have been countless variations of Pai Sho through the centuries and each culture has its own rules and variations of the game.,9,3,35
Bolin,"That's no help at all. Korra, as the Avatar, you need to standardize these Pai Sho rules.",9,3,35
Korra,"[Sarcastically.] Okay, I'll put that on my to-do list, right after bringing back the Air Nation and taking down the group that tried to kidnap me.",9,3,35
Bolin,That's cool. Whenever you get to it.,9,3,35
Mako,"Assuming we do find Zaheer, what then?",9,3,35
Korra,Then I make him talk.,9,3,35
Mako,"He was locked away for thirteen years, Korra, and never broke. I don't think a little bending is going to intimidate this guy.",9,3,35
Korra,You have a better idea?,9,3,35
Mako,"Yeah, we spy on them. If Aiwei and Zaheer don't know they're being watched, they'll talk freely. Then we'll find out who they are and what they want.",9,3,35
Bolin,"That's just like Pai Sho! [Reading from the book.] In order to defeat your opponent, you first have to know your opponent.",9,3,35
Asami,Then I guess I know you pretty well. [Makes a winning move.] I win.,9,3,35
Bolin,"What? Ugh. All right, you know what that was just a fluke. Best two out of three. [They keep playing many times and Asami keeps winning.] Oh, come on! Best four out of seven. Eight out of fifteen. Seventeen out of thirty-three? [Time passes by and it gets close to sundown, and Bolin gets close to finally winning.] Ha, ha! Looks like you're on the ropes this time.",9,3,35
Asami,"I can't believe it. You might actually win this one. [Right at that moment, Pabu leaps off of Naga and onto the board, scattering the pieces.]",9,3,35
Bolin,"No, Pabu? [Crying a little bit.] Why? [The doll's head falls off and rolls near him.]",9,3,35
Korra,It's almost sundown. Why hasn't Aiwei left yet?,9,3,35
Asami,Maybe he sneaked out when you weren't looking.,9,3,35
Mako,"No, I just saw him peeking out of his window fifteen minutes ago. It's in my logbook.",9,3,35
Korra,I'm going over there. [Leaves the room.],9,3,35
Mako,"Korra, wait! You're going to blow our element of surprise. [Nevertheless, Team Avatar follows her. Korra busts down Aiwei's door with airbending.]",9,3,35
Korra,"It's over, Aiwei! Where's ...? [Korra looks and sees Aiwei meditating on his bed.] What?",9,3,35
Bolin,That's a weird way to nap.,9,3,35
Korra,"He's not sleeping. He's meditating. Wait! Asami, those spirits were trying to tell us something earlier. Xai Bau's Grove isn't on the map because it's not in the physical world! It's in the Spirit World! I'm going in after him. [Sits down beside Aiwei.]",9,3,35
Mako,We'll watch him in case he wakes up. Be careful!,9,3,35
,Korra meditates and successfully passes into the Spirit World. She looks from behind a tree and sees Aiwei standing on a nearby hill in front of another tree. Zaheer materializes across from him.,9,3,35
Zaheer,"What happened back in Zaofu? You told me we wouldn't have any problems getting the Avatar? Because of you, we've all been compromised.",9,3,35
Aiwei,"No, any evidence was destroyed when my library burned.",9,3,35
Zaheer,Where is your physical body now?,9,3,35
Aiwei,At the Misty Palms Inn. But there is no need to worry. I was not followed.,9,3,35
Zaheer,You left a loose end.,9,3,35
Aiwei,"I assure you, no one knows anything about us.",9,3,35
Zaheer,"[Angrily.] No, you are the loose end. [Grabs hold of Aiwei.]",9,3,35
Korra,Zaheer!,9,3,35
,"Zaheer teleports himself and Aiwei toward a cliff at the rim of the Fog of Lost Souls and throws Aiwei off it, before he teleports back to the tree.",9,3,35
Zaheer,It seems Aiwei was mistaken. He was followed.,9,3,35
Korra,"That's right. We knew he'd lead us straight to you. Now, what did you do with him?",9,3,35
Zaheer,"He'll be spending eternity in the Fog of Lost Souls, which just leaves the two of us. [He takes a step forward.]",9,3,35
Korra,"Don't move, Zaheer. You're going to give me some answers.",9,3,35
Zaheer,"[Sits back down.] There's no need for aggression. Neither of us has our bending, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll answer whatever questions you have. You deserve that much. [Pauses, as Korra looks surprised.] What would you like to know?",9,3,35
Korra,"First off, who are you people, and why do you keep trying to take me?",9,3,35
Zaheer,"We are part of a secret society, dedicated to restoring freedom to the world. We are the Red Lotus.",9,3,35
Korra,Red Lotus? Are you related to the White Lotus?,9,3,35
Zaheer,"We are what the White Lotus was meant to be. But after the Hundred Year War, the White Lotus lost its true purpose. Its members came out of hiding and openly served the Avatar. They became nothing but glorified bodyguards who served corrupt nations. So a great man named Xai Bau broke from the White Lotus and began his own society.",9,3,35
Korra,"That's a great story, but it doesn't explain why you tried to take me when I was a kid.",9,3,35
Zaheer,That was Unalaq's idea.,9,3,35
Korra,What? My uncle was part of the Red Lotus?,9,3,35
,"Scene shifts to the Red Lotus hideout, as Zaheer's physical body begins to speak to his companions.",9,3,35
Zaheer,Avatar Korra. Misty Palms Inn. Find her.,9,3,35
P-Li,You two go. I'll stay here and make sure Zaheer's body is safe.,9,3,35
,Ming-Hua and Ghazan leave. The scene shifts back to Xai Bau's Grove.,9,3,35
Zaheer,"I met your uncle when I was a teenager, after we had both joined the Red Lotus. We learned about Raava and Vaatu, and how Avatar Wan foolishly severed them, disrupting the balance of the world forever.",9,3,35
Korra,Avatar Wan wasn't foolish! He was trying to restore balance.,9,3,35
Zaheer,"He closed the portals, severing humans from spirits. Even you realize the error in his ways.",9,3,35
Korra,"So all along, you and my uncle planned to use me to open the portals and release Vaatu? That's why you tried to take me when I was a kid?",9,3,35
Zaheer,"Yes, and with members of the Red Lotus as your elemental masters, we could've taught you so much.",9,3,35
Korra,It sounds like you were just trying to brainwash me so I'd do whatever you wanted.,9,3,35
Zaheer,"No, Korra. All I wanted was to show the Avatar a better path for the world.",9,3,35
,Scene shifts back to the rest of Team Avatar in the physical world. Mako glances out of the window and sees Ming-Hua and Ghazan.,9,3,35
Mako,"Uh, I don't know how, but Water Arm Lady and Lava Guy found us. [Bolin gasps and Asami stands up.]",9,3,35
Asami,How?,9,3,35
Mako,I just said I don't know how!,9,3,35
Bolin,"[Frantically shaking Korra.] Korra, come on! Wake up!",9,3,35
Asami,What do we do?,9,3,35
Mako,[Mako carries Korra and places her on Naga.] Get Korra out of here. Bolin and I will hold them off.,9,3,35
,"The door opens and Asami rides off on Naga, holding Korra.",9,3,35
Ming-Hua,The Avatar!,9,3,35
,"Naga turns a corner, and Ming-Hua fires ice shards at her, but misses. She begins fighting Mako, while Bolin takes on Ghazan. The Red Lotus earthbender knocks down the two brothers with lavabending. The scene shifts back to Xai Bau's Grove.",9,3,35
Korra,"If my uncle came up with a plan to abduct me when I was a kid, why wasn't he caught?",9,3,35
Zaheer,"He wasn't with us that night, and he covered up his involvement afterwards.",9,3,35
Korra,"So he betrayed you, just like he betrayed me.",9,3,35
Zaheer,Yes. He allowed me and my friends to remain in prison while he pursued his own selfish goals. Unalaq becoming a Dark Avatar was never part of our mission.,9,3,35
Korra,"And what is your mission, exactly?",9,3,35
Zaheer,I want what you want: to restore balance to this world.,9,3,35
Korra,I don't think our ideas of balance are the same.,9,3,35
Zaheer,Are you sure about that? You kept the spirit portals open. But why stop there? Bringing the spirits back should only be the beginning.,9,3,35
Korra,What do you mean?,9,3,35
Zaheer,The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate. You've had to deal with a moronic president and a tyrannical queen. Don't you think the world would be better off if leaders like them were eliminated?,9,3,35
Korra,"No. I mean, I don't really agree with what they've done, but taking out world leaders isn't the answer.",9,3,35
Zaheer,"It wasn't too long ago that the airbenders were nearly all wiped out, thanks to the Fire Lord's desire for world dominance. True freedom can only be achieved when oppressive governments are torn down.",9,3,35
Korra,But that won't bring balance. It will throw the world into chaos.,9,3,35
Zaheer,"Exactly. The natural order is disorder. Do you know who once said, ""New growth cannot exist without first the destruction of the old""?",9,3,35
Korra,No.,9,3,35
Zaheer,The wise Guru Laghima. An airbender.,9,3,35
,"The scene shifts to the battle at the Misty Palms Inn. Ming-Hua attacks Mako with waterbending, but he avoids it and firebends back at her, which she also blocks. She begins repeatedly attacking him, overwhelming him. Meanwhile, Ghazan harasses Bolin with lavabending.",9,3,35
Bolin,I can't beat this guy! It's like I'm giving him ammo! Want to trade?,9,3,35
,"Mako runs near a wall and jumps to avoid another one of Ming-Hua's waterbending attacks. He tries to fight back, but Ming-Hua pins him against a door with ice, grinning evilly. She picks him off the door and throws him against another door, stunning him. Meanwhile Bolin jumps into the pool to avoid Ghazan's attacks, and swims toward the bottom, but Ming-Hua traps him in a sphere of water and brings him up to the surface.",9,3,35
Ming-Hua,Go get the Avatar! I have these two under control.,9,3,35
,"Ghazan runs off. Ming-Hua picks up a limp Mako; Bolin surfaces, gasping, from the water sphere. Meanwhile, Naga has made progress and is running up a hill outside of the town, but she is quickly trapped in an earth tent. The scene shifts back to Xai Bau's Grove.",9,3,35
Zaheer,"You know, being locked away for so many years, I was beginning to lose hope. [Stands up.] But when I awoke with airbending, I knew I would be the one to destroy the old world and plant seeds for a new world to flourish.",9,3,35
Korra,"[Stands up as well.] Zaheer, please, as an airbender, you could help make a positive difference in the world, instead of destroying it.",9,3,35
Zaheer,"You're a very smart young woman, Korra. But you must realize that once change begins, it cannot be stopped, even by the Avatar.",9,3,35
Korra,"Enough with your philosophical mumbo-jumbo! I want to know one thing. If you do capture me, what are you going to do with me?",9,3,35
Zaheer,You'll have that answer soon enough. The Red Lotus should have you by now. See you in the physical world. [His spiritual body starts to leave Xai Bau's Grove.],9,3,35
Korra,"Zaheer! [Starts to run toward the tree, but stops. She goes back to the physical world, and finds herself tied up by a strait jacket and muzzled along with other restraints.] Zaheer, you tricked me! Let me go! [Sees Asami handcuffed near her.] Asami, are you okay? Where's the rest of the Red Lotus?",9,3,35
Asami,"What's the Red Lotus? And Zaheer didn't capture us, the Earth Queen's forces did.",9,3,35
Korra,Where are we?,9,3,35
Asami,I'm not sure. Some camp by the desert. They're taking us back to Ba Sing Se.,9,3,35
,The scene shifts to the Red Lotus hideout.,9,3,35
Ghazan,"The Earth Queen's army snatched up the Avatar before I could. [Ming-Hua and Ghazan drop Mako and Bolin, who are tied up and visibly battered.]",9,3,35
Ming-Hua,But we figured you could find a use for these two.,9,3,35
Zaheer,Load them in the truck. We're taking a trip to Ba Sing Se.,9,3,35
,Cut to credits.,9,3,35
,The scene starts in a building in the midst of the desert where a group of people walks toward an Earth Kingdom airship. Camera cuts to ground level as a soldier pushes the dolly Korra is on while Asami walks forward with her head bowed down.,10,3,36
Korra,[Locked up.] You have to let me out! The Earth Queen is in danger from a group of terrorists calling themselves the Red Lotus. [Turns her attention to the captain as she is pushed up the ramp leading into the airship.] I talked to one of them in the Spirit World yesterday. He's insane!,10,3,36
Captain,[With a toothpick between his lips.] Screaming about terrorists in the Spirit World? You're the one who sounds insane. [Turns and walks inside his ship and the hatch closes.],10,3,36
,"The engine is turned on, and the airship begins to fly. The scene cuts to Korra being locked in a cell with Asami. After locking Korra to the wall, the crew chains Asami to the floor.",10,3,36
Asami,[Sweet-talking.] Do I have to be chained to the floor the whole way? It's going to be so uncomfortable.,10,3,36
Arik,"[Chains Asami.] Sorry Ma'am, I'm under orders.",10,3,36
Asami,"Can't you just chain me to that railing? [Looks at the railing on the wall.] I mean, where am I gonna go? [The ship crew glances on Asami.] Please?",10,3,36
Arik,"Well, as long as you're chained up, I guess it doesn't make a difference. [Chains Asami to the railing.]",10,3,36
Asami,"Thank you, Sir.",10,3,36
Korra,Can I have ... some water?,10,3,36
Arik,"No water. We're also not going to bring you any rocks or fire, so don't ask. I guess there's air, but there's nothing we can do about that. We're not opening your compartment 'til we reach Ba Sing Se. [Walks out of the cell.]",10,3,36
Korra,I hoped Mako or Bolin would have shown up to save us by now. I wonder if they're okay.,10,3,36
,Scene changes to a truck driving along a desert road. Cut to the inside of the Red Lotus' truck with Zaheer driving and P'Li sitting besides him in front.,10,3,36
Mako,"[Voice-over.] If you think [Cut to the back of the truck where Ghazan and Ming-Hua are seated on a bench and looking at the brothers tied up together on the floor.] holding us hostage will give you some leverage against the Avatar, you're gonna be very disappointed.",10,3,36
Ming-Hua,Can't we just enjoy our time together in silence?,10,3,36
Mako,And why did you need Korra alive back in Zaofu? You had her paralyzed. Why didn't you just take her out when you had the chance?,10,3,36
Ghazan,"Look, all you need to know is that the world is about to change, for the better.",10,3,36
Bolin,"So you guys were like locked up for fifteen years, huh? It must've been like crazy boring.",10,3,36
Ghazan,"Actually, it was only thirteen years. But it felt like thirty.",10,3,36
Bolin,"I mean, what did you do with all that time? Did you sing songs, work on crafts?",10,3,36
Ming-Hua,Not a lot of craft supplies in a volcanic prison cell.,10,3,36
Ghazan,"And I must've renamed the constellations about a thousand times. When it rained, that was a big event.",10,3,36
Ming-Hua,[Sighs.] I would've killed for some rain. Mostly I just made up stories about the guards: who was having trouble with his girlfriend; which one secretly wished he'd become a pastry chef.,10,3,36
Bolin,"Ooh okay, that sounds like fun. Let me try that on you guys. [To Ghazan.] You were raised by an older sister, your mustache grew in when you were ten and I'm sensing - just sensing - an unspoken attraction between you two.",10,3,36
,"Ming-Hua and Ghazan glance at each other awkwardly. Ming-Hua gives Ghazan a sulking look and turns away, surprising the lavabender.",10,3,36
Ghazan,[Smiles at Bolin.] Two out of three. Not bad.,10,3,36
Mako,"Bolin, would you stop making friends with the bad guys?",10,3,36
Bolin,Sorry!,10,3,36
Zaheer,"Ghazan, gag those two. We're almost there.",10,3,36
,"Cut to a far shot of the truck entering Ba Sing Se. The scene changes to the airship flying above Si Wong Desert, before to the interior where Korra struggles against her restraints, but to no avail.",10,3,36
Korra,We have to find a way to get out of this prison before we get to the Earth Queen.,10,3,36
Asami,"Don't worry, I have a plan. These airships the Cabbage Corp sold to the Earth Kingdom are way cheaper than the ones Future Industries built.",10,3,36
,"Asami stands against the wall and struggles, pulling off the railing. She jumps to bring her hands in front before throwing the railing to catch it upright.",10,3,36
Asami,"Now that's just shoddy workmanship. [Walks up to Korra.] There's no way I can get these locks off. I need the keys. [Looks at the floor before prying a panel open with the railing.] Give me five minutes, then start yelling for help.",10,3,36
,Asami crawls down the pane. The scene changes to the palace.,10,3,36
Hou-Ting,When is the Avatar scheduled for delivery?,10,3,36
Gun,The airship already left Fort Bosco and should be arriving in a few hours.,10,3,36
Hou-Ting,Excellent. Bring it to me as soon as it lands.,10,3,36
Gun,"Yes, Your Majesty. But first there are some ... people here who captured two of the Avatar's friends. They would like to present them to you personally.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,You know I don't meet with bounty hunters.,10,3,36
Gun,And of course I told them that. But they say they have some information that might interest you; about the location of your stolen airbenders.,10,3,36
Hou-Ting,"Really? [Smiles.] Fine, send them in. [The Red Lotus enter the throne room, throwing the bound and gagged Mako and Bolin in the meantime.] Ah, yes, I remember these two. We'll find an acceptable home for you in prison, with the rest of the dissidents. [To the Red Lotus.] Now, I'm told you have some information for me. I hope this isn't just some ruse to increase your bounty.",10,3,36
Zaheer,"We don't want any bounty, Your Majesty. You can consider these two a ""thank you"" gift for simply taking the time to talk to us.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,"How very magnanimous. So, where are my airbenders?",10,3,36
Zaheer,"I'd be happy to tell you, once you hand the Avatar over to me.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,[Furious.] Who told you that we have the Avatar?!,10,3,36
Zaheer,"How I know is not important. But if I found out, others will too. And that could put you in a difficult position.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,Is that so?,10,3,36
Zaheer,"Your Majesty, imprisoning the Avatar will cause the other nations to turn against you and demand her freedom. Before long, we'd be in the midst of a sticky international incident. If you let me take her today, no one need ever know she was here, and you can get your airbenders back without interference. We both win.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,And what do you plan to do with the Avatar should I see fit to grant your request.,10,3,36
Zaheer,All I can say is: I have business with her. But she won't be bothering you again. I can assure you of that. [Mako and Bolin glance at each other with worried looks.],10,3,36
Hou-Ting,"[Cut to the queen, who ponders over the deal while tapping her long finger nails on the arm of the throne. She sits up straight with a smile after some consideration.] I find these terms agreeable. Gun, escort them to the antechamber until the Avatar's arrival. [Gun escorts the Red Lotus out of the throne room.] Send these two to the dungeon. [Two Dai Li agents open the floor beneath Mako and Bolin, leaving them to drop into the unknown.]",10,3,36
,"The scene changes to the airship flying above the desert. Cut to the outside of the cell, where Arik stands guard.",10,3,36
Korra,Guards! [Arik runs to the door.] Get in here! [Arik opens the hatch.] Something happened to my friend. She needs help.,10,3,36
Arik,[Point of view.] Where is she?,10,3,36
,"Arik is knocked out by Asami. She opens the door, triumphantly spinning the keys around her finger. She frees Korra from the straitjacket while Korra removes the muzzle.",10,3,36
Korra,Nice work. Now let's take control of the ship.,10,3,36
,"Cut to the cockpit of the airship where Korra barges in with metalbending. The co-pilot runs up, but is knocked against the steering wheel by an air blast, causing the airship to lose control.",10,3,36
Captain,Mayday! Mayday! The Avatar has escaped. We're going down in quadrant four of the Si Wong Desert.,10,3,36
,"The co-pilot regains consciousness and charges Korra, before being knocked against the captain by another air blast. Asami runs up to the steering wheel.",10,3,36
Asami,"I think you might have been a little over-aggressive with the airbending. The controls are busted. [Picks up the radio phone which has broken into two.] Also, you broke the radio.",10,3,36
Korra,"Sorry, but it's not my fault this airship's a hunk of junk.",10,3,36
Asami,[As the airship is about to crash into a sand dune.] Hang on to something! [The ship crashes.],10,3,36
,Korra and Asami climb out of the airship from the roof.,10,3,36
Asami,"Well. They say any landing you could walk away from is a good landing. [Stares at the vastness of the desert.] But, given our location, I'm not so sure about that.",10,3,36
Korra,You're the engineer. What do you think? Can we get flying again?,10,3,36
Asami,"It doesn't look good. Even if you metalbend the propellers back into shape, we have to dig this whole thing out of the sand.",10,3,36
Korra,[As the crew climb out of the airship.] Is everyone all right?,10,3,36
Arik,Like you care.,10,3,36
Kong,What the heck happened?,10,3,36
Arik,"She said her friend needed help, then they knocked me out!",10,3,36
Korra,I'm sorry. But I couldn't let you take me to the Earth Queen as a captive. There are dangerous forces at work that you don't know anything about.,10,3,36
Kong,More dangerous than being stranded in the desert?,10,3,36
Captain,"[Climbs out of the airship.] Don't worry, Kong. I've radioed Ba Sing Se before we went down. We just need to sit tight. Somebody will be here to rescue us.",10,3,36
Korra,I'm not waiting around for that. We need to get out of here now.,10,3,36
Asami,"If we all work together, we might be able to get the ship up and running.",10,3,36
Kong,Not likely. I just tunneled out the engine room. It's like a sandbox in there.,10,3,36
Captain,This ship isn't going anywhere. And neither are you. You're prisoners and it's our duty to transport you to the Earth Queen.,10,3,36
Korra,"[Smiles coyly.] You realize that I'm the Avatar, right? [Frowns and points a finger at the airmen.] You don't want to fight me.",10,3,36
Captain,I'm afraid you aren't giving us much of a choice. We have our orders.,10,3,36
Asami,"[Notices a moving sand dune.] Wait, did that sand dune just move?",10,3,36
Captain,It was probably just a mirage. The desert will play tricks on you.,10,3,36
Asami,[As the sand dune moves again.] That's no mirage. Look.,10,3,36
Kong,"I heard that since all the spirits came back, this desert has been haunted by them.",10,3,36
Korra,"[Sarcastically.] Oh right, so I guess that's my fault too. Do you want to help us get this ship up and running, or do you want to wait around and meet that thing?[Points to the moving sand dune.]",10,3,36
Kong,"We want to fix the ship. Right, Cap? [The other crew members nod in unison.]",10,3,36
Captain,Let's get to work.,10,3,36
Korra,Everybody stand back.,10,3,36
,"Korra prepares herself and bends a large air spout at the sand dune. The scene changes to the prison cell, where a guard patrols past the cells, knocking on the bars with a baton. As he walks past Mako and Bolin's cell, he hits Bolin who was leaning against the bars, causing him to grunt in annoyance.",10,3,36
Mako,We have to find a way out of here before Zaheer gets his hands on Korra.,10,3,36
Prisoner,[Pulls out a mirror to reflect his face to the cell.] Take me with you. I haven't seen my wife and five kids for four years.,10,3,36
Bolin,Four years?,10,3,36
Prisoner,"[Upbeat.] The first few months were great, I-I could finally get some sleep, but ... [Dejectedly.] now I really miss them.",10,3,36
Mako,"[Ignoring their neighbor.] Listen. Bolin, this is up to you. I know you can metalbend.",10,3,36
Prisoner,You can metalbend?,10,3,36
Bolin,No.,10,3,36
Mako,Yes you can. I believe in you.,10,3,36
Prisoner,"I believe in you too, Bolin.",10,3,36
Bolin,"I appreciate that, Mako, and fellow ... prisoner man. But I've been trying and trying and trying and I've never been able to do it. Not even a little.",10,3,36
Mako,You've always had the ability deep down. You just haven't had the motivation. But this is your time! Get us out of here to save Korra. You can do it! [Rallying the other prisoners.] Bolin! Bolin!,10,3,36
Other prisoners,Bolin! Bolin! Bolin! Bolin!,10,3,36
Bolin,"You're right. [Readying himself.] Okay, here I go. Metalbending. [Attempts to metalbend the bars, but to no avail. Sinks onto the floor, tearing.] I can't metalbend.",10,3,36
Other prisoners,Aww! [Return to their activities.],10,3,36
Prisoner,"Hey, you guys didn't happen to bring any toilet paper, do you?",10,3,36
,"Cut to Lin driving a jeep when she notices some tire tracks. She reverses and drives up the abandoned jeep. As she inspects the it, Naga leaps from behind, growling aggressively, startling her. Naga soon recognizes Lin and smiles, running around her and licking her.",10,3,36
Lin,"First, you scare the life out of me, now you want to lick me.",10,3,36
,Naga licks Lin once more. Pabu emerges from the jeep and crawls on Lin's body. Lin manages to grab Pabu by the neck and put him on top of Naga.,10,3,36
Lin,"[Passes treats to the animals.] Here, chew on this [Walks off.] and leave me alone. [Picks up a radio phone on the jeep.] Tonraq, you read me?",10,3,36
Tonraq,"Yes, we copy.",10,3,36
Lin,"I've found Korra's jeep, but the kids aren't here. Meet me at the Misty Palms Oasis.",10,3,36
,Cut to the Si Wong Desert where Asami welds the rudder. The exit hatch opens and Korra and Kong walk out.,10,3,36
Asami,How's it looking in there?,10,3,36
Korra,I just airbent all the sand out of the engine room. I think it's clean.,10,3,36
Kong,Hasn't been this clean since it floated off the showroom floor.,10,3,36
Korra,How's it going out here?,10,3,36
Asami,"Well, she's still pretty banged up, but I think she might be able to limp out of the desert. Kong, you want to see if you can get the engine started?",10,3,36
Kong,Aye aye!,10,3,36
,"Kong walks back into the airship. Soon, the propellers begin to spin.",10,3,36
Arik,All right!,10,3,36
,"A sand shark jumps from beneath the surface and grabs the airship, snapping it into two. Korra and Asami look in fear before running away with the crew, narrowly missing the sand shark's dive, causing the doomed airship to sink below.",10,3,36
Korra,"That's no spirit! [Everyone stands up when the dust subsides. Scene zooms out to show Kong at the helms unharmed, though paralyzed with fear.] I think it's gone now.",10,3,36
Arik,"Kong, are you all right? What are we going to do? All of our supplies were on the ship. We've got no food, no water.",10,3,36
Captain,"Easy, Arik. Another ship is on the way. We just need to hold our position for a few hours.",10,3,36
Asami,We might not have a few hours.,10,3,36
Korra,How far are we from the edge of the desert?,10,3,36
Captain,"Too far to walk, if that's what you're thinking.",10,3,36
Arik,[Slumps to the floor.] We can't just wait around to for that thing to pick us off one by one!,10,3,36
Captain,"You'll do as you're told, Airman. Now get a hold of yourself!",10,3,36
Asami,[Examining the mess.] Maybe we can still build something to get us all out of here.,10,3,36
Captain,[Sarcastic.] You want to make some wings out of scrap metal and flap real hard?,10,3,36
Asami,"No, but we might have enough material to construct a makeshift sand-sailer. Like the sandbenders use to get around. All we need is a sail and some kind of sled to attach it to.",10,3,36
Korra,It's worth a try.,10,3,36
Captain,Gather every piece of metal you can find. We'll give that sandy beast a run for his money yet.,10,3,36
,"Cut to the Red Lotus' chamber. A Dai Li agent walks past the door, alerting the Red Lotus.",10,3,36
Zaheer,Looks like he's in hurry. Wait here.,10,3,36
,"Zaheer leaves the chamber and, after noticing no one around, stalks the Dai Li agent. As the agent opens the throne room door, he leaps up against the wall, entering the throne room via the ceiling lattice.",10,3,36
Dai Li agent,"Your Majesty, we received a distress signal from the airship carrying the prisoners. We believed the ship crashed in the Si Wong desert and the Avatar may have escaped.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,[Angrily.] This is outrageous! Send another airship to retrieve the Avatar immediately.,10,3,36
Dai Li agent,"It's already on its way, Your Majesty.",10,3,36
,Zaheer leaves the throne room and returns to his chambers.,10,3,36
Ming-Hua,What are we going to do now?,10,3,36
Ghazan,There's no way we can track her down in the desert before the queen gets to her.,10,3,36
P'Li,You really think we'd be lucky enough to capture her again? She'll be long gone by the time they arrive.,10,3,36
Zaheer,It doesn't matter. We're through chasing her. It's time to make her come to us.,10,3,36
,The Red Lotus barge into the throne room.,10,3,36
Hou-Ting,What is this riff-raff doing in my throne room unannounced?,10,3,36
Zaheer,"Apologies, Your Majesty. But I couldn't help overhearing that the Avatar won't be joining us today.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,"The Avatar is still in my custody. However, eavesdropping on royal conversations will land you in a cell right next to those boys you brought in. Now, if you value your freedom, you'll tell me where the airbenders are right now!",10,3,36
Zaheer,That wasn't the deal.,10,3,36
Hou-Ting,I will not bandy words with bounty hunters! [To Dai Li.] Seize these hoodlums and throw them in prison until they decide to show proper respect for the crown!,10,3,36
,"Dai Li agents surround the Red Lotus. P'Li fires a combustion beam to the floor, knocking off a group of Dai Li agents. Three Dai Li agents fire rock gloves at Ghazan, who easily redirected them back to the agents. A Dai Li agent attacks Zaheer with an earthbending attack from below, though he is able to leap up to avoid the attack and counter with an air blast. Another Dai Li agent attacks him from the pillar, only to be knocked against the pillar. The third agent runs up to Zaheer, only to be thrown away and frozen against a pillar by Ming-Hua. Gun, noticing the battle, runs away.",10,3,36
Hou-Ting,"Gun! Get in back here and lay down your life for your queen, you coward! [Notices Zaheer walking forward and follows suit.] You wouldn't dare attack a queen!",10,3,36
Zaheer,"[Leaps to the throne.] Maybe I forgot to mention something to you. I don't believe in queens. [Pulls air out of Hou-Ting's lungs and traps her head in a vacuum sphere, leaving her gasping and collapsed onto the floor.] You think freedom is something that you can give or take on a whim ... [Close-up of Hou-Ting with bloodshot eyes.] To your people ... freedom is just as essential as ... air. And without it ... there is no life. [Stops bending.] There is only ... darkness.",10,3,36
,Cut to the radio control room as the Red Lotus walks in.,10,3,36
Radio operator,Hey! You can't be in here!,10,3,36
Zaheer,No need for alarm. I just need to make an announcement to the entire city. How do I do that?,10,3,36
Radio operator,Who do you think you are?,10,3,36
Ming-Hua,[Grabs the radio operator.] He's the man who just took down the Earth Queen. You want to be next?!,10,3,36
Zaheer,"Ming-Hua, please. We're here to help citizens like him, not hurt them. [To the radio operator.] Now, can you help me?",10,3,36
,"The radio operator nods before Ming-Hua throws him to the seat. He sets the controls and bows to Zaheer, who takes the seat.",10,3,36
Zaheer,"Attention citizens of Ba Sing Se. I have an important announcement to make. [Cut to a household listening to the message.] Moments ago, the Earth Queen was brought down by the hands of revolutionaries, [Cut to Mako and Bolin's paternal family, who listen at the news with disbelief.] including myself. I'm not going to tell you my name, because my identity is not important. [Cut to Mako and Bolin at their cell.] I'm not here to take over the Earth Kingdom. I think you've had enough of leaders telling you what to do. It's time for you to find your own path. No longer will you be oppressed by tyrants. From now on, you are free! [Cut to Ghazan standing before the Inner Wall.] I deliver Ba Sing Se be into the hands of the people!",10,3,36
,"Ghazan readies himself and punches the floor, melting it to lava. Soon, the Inner Wall begins to melt. With a stomp, the wall collapses. Bystanders brace themselves from the collapsing wall and cheer when the dust settles before making their way out, while Ghazan looks on. Cut to the prison where the prisoners begin rioting. Mako has managed to melt off a section of the bar, shaking his wrist with the the strain before resuming.",10,3,36
Mako,"We have to get out of here, Bolin. Zaheer came here to take out the Earth Queen, and now Korra is next.",10,3,36
Prisoner,You know that guy? He's my hero!,10,3,36
Mako,Shut up! [To Bolin.] You have to metalbend us out of here. C'mon! I know you can do it! This is your time!,10,3,36
Bolin,"You said before ""was my time"".",10,3,36
Mako,"I know I did it, but now it's really your time. [Bolin stands up.] Do it!",10,3,36
,"Bolin readies himself and metalbends again. Cut to the prison where all the prison doors, except theirs, open. The prisoners laugh and run out.",10,3,36
Bolin,"Did you see that? I did it! I mean, not for us, but I metalbent all the other cells open!",10,3,36
Mako,[Palm to his face.] I don't think that was you.,10,3,36
,"Mako and Bolin notice Zaheer approach them and prepare to attack, though were quickly neutralized by an air blast.",10,3,36
Zaheer,"Listen to me. I'm going to set you free, but I want to talk to you first. I have a message that I need you to take to Korra.",10,3,36
,Cut to the Si Wong Desert where Arik welds finishing touches to the sand-sailer.,10,3,36
Asami,"She ain't pretty, but I think she'll do the job.",10,3,36
Korra,[Notices the approaching sand shark's dorsal fin.] No time for a test run. Let's move!,10,3,36
,"Everyone boards the sand-sailer. Korra readies herself and bends a large gust of air, moving the sand-sailer. Cut to Asami at the helm as the beast approaches them. Far shot of the beast jumping out, but missed before making another unsuccessful attempt. Cut to the sand-sailer leaving as the sand shark's sand trail disappears.",10,3,36
Arik,I think he's gone. We did it!,10,3,36
,"The sand shark emerges from beneath the sand-sailer, preparing to devour it whole. Korra firebends into the mouth, saving them. The beast returns to the sand, pushing the sand-sailer from beneath. Cut to later on the day, when the sand-sailer made its way to the Misty Palms Oasis, where they park the vehicle next to onlooking sandbenders before the sail and mast break off.",10,3,36
Asami,You want to buy a slightly used sand-sailer?,10,3,36
,Asami step onto the dock as the last of the group.,10,3,36
Captain,"Thanks, Asami. You got a good head on your shoulders.",10,3,36
Korra,I'm sorry for getting us stranded out there. I didn't mean for that to happen.,10,3,36
Captain,"You know, whatever the conflict between you and the queen is, I'm sure it's above my pay grade. [Shakes Korra's hand with his hooked right hand.] You've got a tough job. Good luck, Avatar. [Salutes.]",10,3,36
Arik,"Captain, have we been in the desert for too long? Or is that really a dragon over there?",10,3,36
,"The crew turns to see Druk on the ground, while two camels tied to a tree avoid the dragon, shivering in fear.",10,3,36
Captain,"Ugh, let's go get a drink.",10,3,36
,Korra watches the airship crew leave before turning to see Naga pin her down and lick her face.,10,3,36
Korra,"Dhaaah! [Giggles.] Easy, girl. Did you think we weren't coming back to you? [Snuggles Naga.]",10,3,36
,"Korra and Asami enter the cantina, where they see Lin, Tonraq and Zuko at the far end. Korra smiles and approaches them.",10,3,36
Korra,[To her father.] What are you all doing here?,10,3,36
Tonraq,"Korra, you're safe. [Hugs his daughter.]",10,3,36
Korra,"Yeah, we made it out of the desert. Thanks to Asami. [Tonraq nods in appreciation to Asami before turning his attention to Korra again.]",10,3,36
Tonraq,Do you remember Lord Zuko?,10,3,36
Zuko,"I met you when you were a very young girl. It's good to see you again, Avatar Korra.",10,3,36
Korra,"It's good to see you, Lord Zuko.",10,3,36
Lin,[Annoyed.] Thanks for ditching me back at Zaofu.,10,3,36
Korra,"Yeah, sorry about that. But, how did you all find us?",10,3,36
Lin,"I am a detective, you know.",10,3,36
Asami,Did you find Mako and Bolin?,10,3,36
Lin,Some people at the inn saw them captured by Zaheer's crew. We don't know where they are.,10,3,36
Tonraq,Did you hear about the Earth Queen?,10,3,36
Korra,What about her?,10,3,36
Radio,"Once again, the Earth Queen's reign has come to an abrupt and violent end. Ba Sing Se has descended into chaos. Rioters and looters have overrun the palace.",10,3,36
Korra,The Red Lotus.,10,3,36
Tonraq,What's that?,10,3,36
Korra,"The name of the group that's been trying to capture me and just took out the Earth Queen. I'm afraid this is only the beginning, Dad.",10,3,36
,Cut to the Misty Palms Oasis as the sun sets.,10,3,36
,Fade to credits.,10,3,36
,"The scene opens to the Upper Ring of Ba Sing Se, covered with fire. An airship takes off in the background. A man stole the Earth Queen's luxurious vase. Another man stole her painting, while people are running in background.",11,3,37
Mako,I can't believe it! The Upper Ring is in chaos!,11,3,37
Looter,[To a Royal Earthbender Guard.] Don't try to stop us; we're taking back what's ours.,11,3,37
Royal Earthbender Guard,Stop you? [Takes off his helmet.] I'm gonna join you. [Points his spear.] I know where the good stuff is.,11,3,37
,The group runs off. Cut to Mako and Bolin where looters run past them.,11,3,37
Bolin,Should we do something?,11,3,37
Mako,This isn't our battle. [Walks out.] We have to deliver Zaheer's message to Korra immediately.,11,3,37
Bolin,"Right. Okay, find Korra, deliver message. [Aerial view of palace.] Yeah, this should be easy. We just got to get out of the city and get to the desert, then somehow find her in the vast expansive wasteland that goes on for thousands, and thousands, of miles. [Sighs.] This isn't gonna be easy.",11,3,37
Mako,[Sees a flying airship.] We need an airship.,11,3,37
,"The brothers run to the docking bay and enter an airship, where looters are stealing airship components.",11,3,37
Mako,"Excuse me, may I have your attention please? I'm with the Republic City Police and I need to commandeer this airship to help the Avatar.",11,3,37
,"The looters, after listening to Mako, resume their activities, oblivious to the brothers.",11,3,37
Bolin,"Let me give it a shot. [To looters.] Hey, the Queen's gold's on the third floor of the palace, second door on the right! [The looters listen in delight and run out; smugly to Mako.] You just got to know how to talk to 'em, bro. [The brothers run to the controls.]",11,3,37
Mako,"What, they took everything. I mean, who rips out a transmission radio?",11,3,37
Bolin,Some folks just do not have respect for other people's property. [Stretches.] Now let's steal this airship!,11,3,37
Mako,You know how to fly this thing?,11,3,37
Bolin,"Technically speaking, no. But, c'mon, how hard could it be?",11,3,37
,"A glass lens falls off the control. Bolin confidently pushes a lever with his right hand, causing the airship to skid forward across the airstrip as citizens scatter.",11,3,37
Mako,Up! Up!,11,3,37
Bolin,"I don't see any up button. I see levers and switches, oh, there it is. [The airship rises.]",11,3,37
,"Cut to the airship flying above Ba Sing Se, which is engulfed with flames.",11,3,37
Mako,The whole city is falling to pieces.,11,3,37
Bolin,"[Worried.] Mako, our family's down there.",11,3,37
Mako,"[Takes over the controls.] Move over, we're getting them out.",11,3,37
Bolin,"Oh, you think just because you dated Asami, you know how to fly this better than me?",11,3,37
Mako,Yeah.,11,3,37
,"Mako pilots the airship above their paternal family's house and opens the hatch. Once they arrive, Bolin slides down the hatch, enters the home via the window, and discovers the family still in the house with no apparent attempts at leaving.",11,3,37
Chow,Bolin? What are you doing here?,11,3,37
Bolin,"I came to get you guys out. This whole block is about to go up in flames. Come on, Mako and I have an airship on the roof.",11,3,37
Tu,We can't. Grandma won't go.,11,3,37
Yin,"This place is my whole world. I will not leave! [Walks up to Bolin.] Oh, but I'm so glad my little Bolin has come back to visit. Sit down, would you like some tea?",11,3,37
Bolin,"[As smoke seeps through the door behind.] Grandma, we don't have time for tea.",11,3,37
Chow,"Mom, please!",11,3,37
Yin,[Obstinately.] No! I can't abandon the place where I raised my family. It's my home.,11,3,37
Bolin,"Grandma, there's one thing Mako and I've learned from all our years on the street. It doesn't matter where you go. [Cut to Yin, with tear-filled eyes.] If you have your family with you, you'll always be at home.",11,3,37
Yin,[Firmly.] I'm not going.,11,3,37
Bolin,Fine! [Slings his grandmother over one shoulder.] You leave me no choice. [To rest of his family.] We're rolling out!,11,3,37
Yin,"Wait. [Takes portrait of Hou-Ting.] Okay, let's go!",11,3,37
,Bolin walks out of the house. The entire family climbs up to the airship. Cut to the airship leaving the house before the fire consumes everything.,11,3,37
Tu,"Thanks for getting us out of there. I mean, I probably could have handled it myself if you guys didn't show up, but, thanks.",11,3,37
Yin,[Hangs the portrait of Hou-Ting.] May she rest in peace. [To Mako.] This airship is nice. Is it our new home?,11,3,37
Mako,"No, Grandma. I'm not sure where we're gonna take you, but right now, we need to find Korra.",11,3,37
Chow,Did something happen to the Avatar?,11,3,37
Mako,"[Pulls out a map.] I'm afraid so. [Opens the map.] Her airship went down somewhere in the desert. She was coming from a military base near the Misty Palms Oasis and heading to Ba Sing Se. If we retrace her route back to the base, we should find the wreckage.",11,3,37
,"Cut to Si Wong Desert at daybreak as everyone in the airship inspect the desert, looking for the wreckage. Some soon become bored and tired.",11,3,37
Tu,"Guys, it's the wreckage! [Mako and Bolin walk up to their cousin.] I found it! [Points to wreckage.] There!",11,3,37
Mako,"That's a Ba Sing Se airship, all right. But where's the rest of it?",11,3,37
Bolin,I don't know. But there's some tracks.,11,3,37
,"The airship follows the tracks created by the sand-sailer. Cut to outside the Misty Palms Oasis where Druk is resting, but flies off upon seeing the airship land heavily.",11,3,37
Bolin,"See, I told you. Landing is hard.",11,3,37
,Cut to the Misty Palms Oasis where numerous spirits have gathered around the iceberg. The family walks up to the iceberg.,11,3,37
Female relative,[Sighs.] Spirits!,11,3,37
Bolin,"Okay, guys. We think Korra found her way back here. [Pabu crawls onto his shoulder.] Now let's split off into teams and scour the town. Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu, now just give me a second while I- wait, Pabu? Pabu! [Hugs his pet while laughing in joy.]",11,3,37
Yin,"[To Chow.] Why is Bolin hugging that big rat? [Chow shakes his head.] Eww, [Turns away in disgust.] now he's kissing it!",11,3,37
Bolin,[Kissing Pabu.] I'm never gonna let you go again!,11,3,37
Tu,"Guys, look out! Giant dog beast thingy!",11,3,37
,"The relatives all scatter, leaving Mako alone, while Naga pounces atop him, licking him.",11,3,37
Mako,"Okay, all right, Naga. It's good to see you, too. Gah! Stop! You're licking my mouth. [Pushes Naga away, spitting in disgust.]",11,3,37
Bolin,[As Korra and Asami run out of the cantina.] Asami! Korra!,11,3,37
Mako,You guys are okay!,11,3,37
,"Bolin and Mako run forward, hugging Asami and Korra respectively. Korra was slightly taken aback by the hug, but returns the favor.",11,3,37
Mako,[Stops hugging Korra; awkwardly.] Sorry. I was just- It's so good to see you.,11,3,37
Korra,"It's really good to see you, too. [Turns to Bolin.] Both of you.",11,3,37
Lin,Good. You guys aren't dead.,11,3,37
Mako,"Don't get all mushy on me, Chief. [Bows.] Tonraq. Sir. [Tonraq nods to him.]",11,3,37
Bolin,"[Slides toward Lord Zuko.] Oh my gosh, it's Lord Zuko! I can't believe it. [Tries to suppress his laughs of excitement.]",11,3,37
Mako,"Uhm, [Pulls Bolin aside.] forgive my brother. We're just really honored to meet you, Sir. [Mako and Bolin bow in respect to Zuko.]",11,3,37
Zuko,[Bows back.] It's a pleasure to meet you as well.,11,3,37
Yin,[Walks up to Asami.] You must be the Avatar. [Asami smiles awkwardly.] Mako told me so much about you. You are even more beautiful than I imagined.,11,3,37
Mako,"[Leading Korra to his grandmother.] Uh, actually, that's Asami. This is Avatar Korra. Korra, this is my grandma, Yin.",11,3,37
Yin,[Holds Korra by the hand.] You are very muscular for a woman.,11,3,37
Korra,"Uhm, thanks. You too?",11,3,37
Yin,"What lovely young women. Mako, why aren't you dating any nice girls like them? [Korra and Asami grimace and smile in awkwardness.]",11,3,37
Asami,"Uh, so what happened to you two? Where have you been?",11,3,37
Mako,We were captured by Zaheer and taken to Ba Sing Se. We were there when the Earth Queen was overthrown.,11,3,37
Korra,What? How did you escape?,11,3,37
Mako,Zaheer let us go.,11,3,37
Korra,What? Why would he do that?,11,3,37
Bolin,Because he wanted us to find you and deliver a message.,11,3,37
Mako,Zaheer is headed to the Northern Air Temple as we speak. He said he's gonna wipe out the new Air Nation and everyone in it. Unless you turn yourself over to him.,11,3,37
,Korra listens to the news in disbelief and worry.,11,3,37
Korra,Zaheer's threatening innocent lives just to get to me.,11,3,37
Tonraq,He could be bluffing.,11,3,37
Mako,He's already taken out the Earth Queen. I don't think he bluffs.,11,3,37
Korra,We need to radio Tenzin and warn him that the Red Lotus is coming.,11,3,37
Mako,"I agree. Unfortunately, we don't have a radio on the airship.",11,3,37
Tonraq,"There's a portable radio on the jeep, but the signal will never make it to the Northern Air Temple.",11,3,37
Lin,We need to get to a place that has a strong radio transmitter. The Metal Clan will have one.,11,3,37
Korra,Let's go. We'll radio Su on the way. Hopefully she can get a hold of Tenzin at the air temple by the time we get to Zaofu.,11,3,37
,"Cut to Zaofu, where the airship and Druk approach the dock. Team Avatar dismount with Suyin and two Metal Clan escort awaiting them.",11,3,37
Korra,Did you have any luck getting through to Tenzin?,11,3,37
Suyin,[Worrying.] No one's answering. What if Zaheer's already up there? I should never have let Opal go.,11,3,37
Lin,"It's going to be okay, Su.",11,3,37
Suyin,I hope so.,11,3,37
,"Cut to the radio room, where a radio operator adjusts the controls.",11,3,37
Radio operator,"We have a strong signal, but no one's answering.",11,3,37
Korra,[Getting impatient.] I can't just sit around here while a madman is on his way to the Northern Air Temple. We have to do something.,11,3,37
Suyin,"I'll ready my airship. With a full force of the Metal Clan security backing us, we can take them. [Leaves the room.]",11,3,37
Mako,We'll never make it up there before Zaheer.,11,3,37
Korra,"There might be another way to stop him. It's a long shot, but Zaheer is always meditating into the Spirit World. And I know exactly where he goes: Xai Bau's Grove. If I can find him there, maybe I could somehow trap him.",11,3,37
Lin,We can't protect you in there. I don't like it.,11,3,37
Korra,I'll be fine. I have to try.,11,3,37
Asami,I'll watch over her as she meditates.,11,3,37
Bolin,"I guess, in the meantime, Mako and I will stay here and try to get through to the temple.",11,3,37
Tonraq,We'll help Su ready the airship.,11,3,37
,"Korra, Asami and Tonraq walk out of the room, leaving the brothers alone with their grandmother.",11,3,37
Yin,I'm going to take a nap.,11,3,37
,"Cut to the garden, where Korra meditates, crossing over to the empty Xai Bau's Grove.",11,3,37
Korra,Zaheer! Come out! Face me! Leave the airbenders out of this! [Notices a figure approaching her from behind.] There you are.,11,3,37
Iroh,"Please don't hurt me, Korra. I'm just an old man.",11,3,37
Korra,Iroh? What are you doing here?,11,3,37
Iroh,"I was just out searching for a new teapot to add to my collection. But instead, I found you. [Chuckles.] In the Spirit World, you always seem to find something you don't know you were looking for. [Notices Korra's troubled expression.] You look troubled.",11,3,37
Korra,I am.,11,3,37
Iroh,Sit. [Both sit.] What is on your mind?,11,3,37
Korra,There's a maniac on the loose and he's threatening to destroy the new Air Nation. I don't know what to do.,11,3,37
Iroh,"Just because you are the Avatar, doesn't mean you will have all the answers.",11,3,37
Korra,I know many Avatars have needed guidance. But I'm the only one since Avatar Wan that can't get help from my past lives. I wish I could talk to Aang.,11,3,37
Iroh,"You know, Zuko and Aang were close friends.",11,3,37
Korra,"Lord Zuko, of course.",11,3,37
Iroh,"Yes, my nephew. Their relationship started off [Shakes his hand.] a little rocky, but they grew to become lifelong friends. Best friends.",11,3,37
Korra,"Thank you! Thank you so much. You're right about the Spirit World. I came here looking for someone else, but I'm glad I found you.",11,3,37
,Korra returns to her physical body.,11,3,37
Asami,Did you find Zaheer?,11,3,37
Korra,"No, he wasn't there. But there's someone I need to talk to. [Walks to Zuko, preparing to mount on Druk.] You're leaving? Aren't you coming to the air temple with us?",11,3,37
Zuko,"I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm going back to the Fire Nation. If it's true that the Red Lotus is targeting the nations' leaders, I need to protect my daughter.",11,3,37
Korra,"I understand. You have to keep the Fire Lord safe. But before you leave, I was wondering if you could help me with something.",11,3,37
Zuko,I was often Aang's counsel and I'd love to be yours.,11,3,37
Korra,That just it. You knew Aang better than anyone. I was wondering if you knew what he might do if he were in my situation.,11,3,37
Zuko,"Hmm. Rebuilding the Air Nation was Aang's biggest dream. He would be beside himself with joy with what you've done. And if he accomplished that goal, he might have sacrificed anything to protect it.",11,3,37
Korra,So he would give himself up to save the Air Nation?,11,3,37
Zuko,"I don't know for sure. The airbenders might have been closest to Aang's heart, but, as the Avatar, he was concerned with people of all nations. No one knew better than Aang that in times of turmoil, [Reaches out to hold Korra by the shoulder.] the world needs its Avatar the most.",11,3,37
Korra,Thanks. Your uncle was right. It was helpful talking to you.,11,3,37
Zuko,"Wait, you spoke with my uncle?",11,3,37
Korra,Yes. In the Spirit World. A couple of times actually. [Zuko listens with surprise as Mako runs toward.],11,3,37
Mako,Guys. We got through to the air temple.,11,3,37
,"The trio run to the radio room, where Bolin is using the radio.",11,3,37
Meelo,Who is this?,11,3,37
Bolin,"[Irritated.] I told you, it's Bolin!",11,3,37
Meelo,[Nose picking.] Bolin's not here right now. Can I take a message?,11,3,37
Bolin,"No! I'm not looking for Bolin, I am Bolin! Gah, look, I need you to find your dad.",11,3,37
Meelo,He's outside with the bison. Did you know we found a whole herd full of baby bison?,11,3,37
Bolin,"No, a whole herd? Really?",11,3,37
Korra,"[Pushes Bolin aside.] Meelo, this is your commanding officer. Go get your dad, now!",11,3,37
Meelo,"[Salutes.] Yes, sir!",11,3,37
Korra,"Come on, come on!",11,3,37
Tenzin,Hello? This is Tenzin.,11,3,37
Korra,Tenzin! Listen to me carefully. Zaheer is on his way to the temple. He's coming for the airbenders. You have to get everyone out of there immediately. Drop everything. Leave! Now!,11,3,37
Tenzin,Oh no.,11,3,37
Korra,"[Cut to Tenzin at the Northern Air Temple radio room.] What? What is it? Tenzin! Tenzin, what's happening?!",11,3,37
Tenzin,It's too late. [Looks at the airship with the Red Lotus.] He's here.,11,3,37
,"Cut to the airship where Zaheer and P'Li are standing. Cut to the airship, which is making circles around the air temple.",11,3,37
Meelo,"[Turns and looks at Tenzin.] What is it, Daddy?",11,3,37
Tenzin,[Looks at the airship. Turns to Meelo.] We need to get everyone out of here. [Grabs his glider. Turns to Meelo.] Stay close to me.,11,3,37
,"Tenzin jumps out of a a window and opens his glider as Meelo follows him. Finally they are landing on a garden where Bumi, Kai and other four airbenders looks at the flying airship.",11,3,37
Bumi,"[Turns to Tenzin.] What's going on, Tenzin?",11,3,37
Tenzin,It's Zaheer. [Camera focuses on Tenzin.] Round everyone up! We need to get to the bison and evacuate immediately!,11,3,37
,"Camera shows Bumi, Kai, and another airbender start running as the airship is flying behind them. Cuts to the airbending training area where Daw and another airbender are training until Kai suddenly shows up.",11,3,37
Kai,"Guys, we got an emergency. We're evacuating the temple. [Waves.] Come on.",11,3,37
,"Kai, Daw, and another airbender start running when lava appears underground and blocking their way.",11,3,37
Kai,Look out!,11,3,37
,"Kai, Daw, and the other airbender eject themselves back. In the next frame the Camera shows Ghazan smiling. Cuts to the meditation room where Kya is meditating with Opal and three other female airbenders. A door sound disturbs them and they turn toward it.",11,3,37
Bumi,[Worried.] It's Zaheer! We have to leave.,11,3,37
,Cuts to Bumi and the others run outside. Opal screams as Ming-Hua grabs her from behind and menaces her with an ice spike.,11,3,37
Ming Hua,"No one's going anywhere, or she gets it.",11,3,37
,Scene shifts to Tenzin and his family running across a bridge. Zaheer soon lands in front of them.,11,3,37
Zaheer,Good. The entire family is here.,11,3,37
,"All the airbenders are rounded up in the courtyard by Ming-Hua, Ghazan, and Zaheer.",11,3,37
Zaheer,It's a pleasure to finally meet a true airbending master.,11,3,37
Tenzin,What is it you want from us?,11,3,37
Zaheer,"Nothing at all. In fact, if everyone cooperates, you will all walk out of this situation unharmed.",11,3,37
Tenzin,Then what are you doing here?,11,3,37
Zaheer,"I want Korra, and I'm tired of chasing her.",11,3,37
Tenzin,You're using us as leverage.,11,3,37
Zaheer,Yes.,11,3,37
Tenzin,[Stands.] I will never let you get to Korra.,11,3,37
Zaheer,"Unfortunately, you don't have a choice.",11,3,37
Tenzin,"Yes, I do.",11,3,37
,Tenzin pushes the three criminals away with airbending.,11,3,37
Tenzin,"Jinora! Get everyone out of here. Bumi, Kya, help me hold them off! [P'Li shoots near Tenzin, but he uses his airbending to protect the group.] And stay out of her line of sight! Go, go!",11,3,37
,"The airbenders all run away. P'Li fires a beam at the exit, though everyone has evacuated. Cut to a overhead shot of the hall as the airship exits while the criminals approach Aang's children. Cut to the frontal shot of the siblings, as Kya bends water from a fountain and forms a ring around her. The Red Lotus ready themselves and Zaheer throws a gust of wind before the scene changes to the airbenders escaping, reaching the end of the sheltered route. They look at the stable and Kai gestures for them to move out, though they are forced to retreat when bombarded with combustion beams.",11,3,37
Pema,It's too dangerous. We'll never make it to the stables with her up there.,11,3,37
,"Cut back to the hall, where Zaheer somersaults, avoiding Tenzin's air blast. He constantly avoids Tenzin's attacks by jumping to new heights. Before reaching the roof, Tenzin manages to land a hit on Zaheer, but he is still able to run off, avoiding the master's attack. Zaheer makes it to the houses attached to the wall, which Tenzin follows, attacking him with a close-range blast which was blocked. Zaheer rises and lands onto the protective wall. Tenzin follows and attacks him from behind, knocking him off balance. Zaheer manages to regain his ground and somersaults, kicking a blast of air a the meantime. Tenzin avoids the attack and fires two quick air blast, which Zaheer avoids by somersaulting above him. Zaheer lands successfully and sends an air kick. Cut to Kya, attempting to redirect Ming-Hua's water appendages, but to no avail. Ming-Hua leaps up and attempts to land a hit on Kya, but she is able to dodge the attack. Ming-Hua freezes the tips of her appendages into ice blades and swings them toward Kya, slicing a statue into pieces, though Kya is able to dodge the attacks. As a blade nearly slices her, she breaks it off and throws it to Ming-Hua. Ming-Hua grabs the blade and throws it back to Kya, sending two more ice spikes in the meantime. Kya manages to break off two of the ice, though is knocked against the wall by the last fragment. Ming-Hua bends a water vortex and charges toward Kya, but she is able to send a large wave of water to Ming-Hua, knocking her off the cliff. Kya walks up to Ming-Hua, though is taken aback to find her bending the directed water into multiple water arms and return to the scene.",11,3,37
Kya,No.,11,3,37
,"Ming-Hua smirks and uses her appendages to knock Kya back into the hall. Bumi jumps down to the first floor with Ghazan giving chase, melting the floor above. Once on the same floor, Ghazan erupts the floor into lava, forcing Bumi to land onto the hall. Ghazan bends the floor beneath Bumi into lava, but he is able to jump out of the way before it erupts. Ghazan directs the lava to Bumi, but he leaps to the wall and charges toward Ghazan with airbending, sliding beneath his legs behind him. He pounces atop the lavabender, grabbing him by the neck and pulling his hair before biting him on the shoulder. Ghazan screams in pain before launching Bumi off with an earth pillar. Kya evades Ming-Hua's attacks before being thrown toward her brother. Both siblings gather in front of a statue of an Air Nomad to catch some breath.",11,3,37
Bumi,I see you're having as much fun as I am.,11,3,37
,"Cut to the bison stable, where P'Li bombards the area with combustion beams. The scene changes to the airbenders hiding in the stable.",11,3,37
Kai,I can't wait any longer. [Grabs his staff.],11,3,37
Jinora,"Wait, what are you doing?",11,3,37
Kai,Whatever I can. [Runs out.] Get to the bison! Get out of here!,11,3,37
,"P'Li fires a combustion beam at Kai, who narrowly misses the attack. The next combustion beam threw Kai off the cliff, though he is able to open his glider and take flight, avoiding multiple combustion beams. As he flies past P'Li, she turns her attention to the fleeing airbenders. Cut to Kai who flies back to the airship, sending an air swipe to P'Li, causing her to misfire and blast the cliff above. P'Li turns her attention to Kai and fires a combustion beam. Kai protects himself with an air ball, but is knocked out. Cut to the fleeing airbenders, where Jinora turns back.",11,3,37
Jinora,[With tears on her eyes.] Kai! No.,11,3,37
,"Cut to an unconscious Kai, plunging down the mountain. Cut to the stable, where the bison took off without the airbenders when confronted with a combustion beam. The airbenders turn to look at the airship. Cut to Bumi, who is knocked back with a water blast. His sister retreats to cover him, freezing her water to block Ghazan's rock, though the next attack shattered the ice. Bumi steps back and nearly loses his footing. Ghazan bends a large earth fissure, throwing the siblings off the temple. Bumi airbends and holds on to the ledge while grabbing his sister.",11,3,37
Bumi,I got you.,11,3,37
,Bumi groans before turning to see P'Li.,11,3,37
Kya,"Bumi, let go!",11,3,37
Bumi,But we could die!,11,3,37
Kya,We're gonna die if we hang on!,11,3,37
,"P'Li directs a combustion beam toward Bumi. Bumi hangs on before letting go, narrowly missing the combustion blast. Both siblings plunge down the cliff before their fall is cushioned by trees, and they land on the cliffside, unconscious. Cut to Tenzin attacking Zaheer with an air blast, which Zaheer dodges. Tenzin jumps behind Zaheer to avoid an attack and counters by arching his back to throw another blast, knocking down Zaheer. Tenzin charges toward Zaheer, but is knocked off by a combustion blast. He cushions his fall with airbending, preparing for another attack, but was struck by Ming-Hua on his right and Ghazan on his left. He dodges barrages of attack by Ming-Hua, Ghazan and Zaheer, though was knocked down. As the Red Lotus surrounds him, he braces himself up and blows off Ghazan and Zaheer. He protects himself in an air sphere, but is blasted against a wall by P'Li. He props himself up, his clothing badly tattered and his face bruised.",11,3,37
Zaheer,Give up. It's over.,11,3,37
Tenzin,"As long as I'm breathing, it's not over.",11,3,37
,"Tenzin strikes Zaheer with a close-range air blast, but misses. The scene pans to the wall, blocking the fight as the Red Lotus launch assaults against Tenzin. Cut to Kai, who is licked in the face, causing him to regain consciousness. The scene zooms out and flips, revealing him hanging upside-down on a tree and the bison calf that licked him awake.",11,3,37
Kai,"Woah! [Free himself and lands onto the bison.] Thanks, buddy. Yip, yip! [The bison flies off.]",11,3,37
,Cut to credits.,11,3,37
,The scene opens to Suyin's airship flying above several mountain ranges.,12,3,38
Suyin,"[Places an airship figurine in front of the temple.] I say we make our approach from the west, drop down from the airship on cables, ambush these Red Lotus low-lives before they know what hit them.",12,3,38
Lin,It will never work. That Combustion Lady will pick us off one by one.,12,3,38
Suyin,You have a better idea on how to save the airbenders?,12,3,38
Lin,"Yeah. We come up from the valley, scale the side of the mountain and take them off guard.",12,3,38
Tonraq,That could work.,12,3,38
Suyin,"And give them the high ground? No, if their lavabender spots us, he'll melt the mountainside and us with it.",12,3,38
Bolin,"Wait, I've got it. I'll disguise myself as a lost hiker, and once I'm in the temple, I'll distract the Red Lotus with my bird calls. [Creates bird calls and whistling.] That's when you all strike.",12,3,38
Mako,"Bird calls, really?",12,3,38
Bolin,Well I haven't noticed you offering any suggestions.,12,3,38
Korra,"It doesn't matter. None of these ideas will work. The second Zaheer realizes we're up to something, he'll wipe out the airbenders.",12,3,38
Suyin,"And Opal is one of those airbenders. Believe me, I understand what's at stake.",12,3,38
Korra,Then I'll think you agree that the only plan that will work is for me to give myself up.,12,3,38
Mako,What?,12,3,38
Lin,"Korra, no.",12,3,38
Tonraq,We'll figure out another way.,12,3,38
Korra,"I talked it over with Lord Zuko, and I've given it a lot of thought. I have to do this.",12,3,38
Asami,You can't expect us to sit by and let Zaheer take you.,12,3,38
Korra,"The world has been out of balance for far too long: it needs the Air Nation back again. I can't let Zaheer destroy it and everyone we love. Help me save the airbenders, then you can worry about saving me.",12,3,38
Tonraq,"[After exchanging glances with Suyin.] We're with you, Korra.",12,3,38
Suyin,"Yes, whatever you need, they're here.",12,3,38
Korra,I'll go radio Zaheer.,12,3,38
,Korra walks out of the meeting room. Cut to the Northern Air Temple radio room.,12,3,38
Korra,"Zaheer, are you there? It's me.",12,3,38
Zaheer,"I've been waiting for your call. So, do we have a deal?",12,3,38
Korra,"Yes. You release the airbenders, and then I'll turn myself over.",12,3,38
Zaheer,"And take away the only leverage I have? No. I can't do that. Listen carefully, here's what I need you to do.",12,3,38
,"Cut to the airship meeting room where Mako is seated, while Bolin walks past him.",12,3,38
Mako,[Annoyed.] Will you sit down? I'm already tense enough as it is.,12,3,38
Bolin,"I'm just worried about Opal, and Pabu's not here to comfort me. [Sighs.] I hope he and Naga are doing okay back in Zaofu.",12,3,38
,"Cut to Zaofu where Naga and Pabu tug at Mako's scarf. Naga stands up, leaving Pabu hanging at the end of the scarf. Yin runs into the room.",12,3,38
Yin,"No, not Mako's scarf! Bad dog and rat thingy! I'm very disappointed in you two. [Naga and Pabu hang their heads in shame.]",12,3,38
,Cut back to the airship where Korra re-enters the room.,12,3,38
Tonraq,Did you speak to Zaheer?,12,3,38
Korra,"[Disappointed.] Yes. He told me to come to the top of Laghima's Peak at noon, alone. Once he has me, he'll release the airbenders over to you at the temple.",12,3,38
Suyin,I think I figured a way to play this so that the airbenders and Korra all come out in one piece.,12,3,38
Lin,How?,12,3,38
Suyin,"Zaheer doesn't know how many of us there are, so we have the numbers advantage. I say we split into two teams: [Places the airship figurine on the temple.] Mako, Bolin and Asami will take the airship up to the temple. [Places a Metal Clan figurine on a mountain.] Meanwhile, my metalbenders, Tonraq, Lin, and I will get in position below Laghima's Peak.",12,3,38
,"Korra nods in agreement to the plan. Cut to the air temple, where Zaheer is meditating.",12,3,38
Zaheer,Let go your earthly tether. Enter the void. Empty and become wind. Empty and become wind. [P'Li walks into the room.],12,3,38
P'Li,The airbenders are secured.,12,3,38
Zaheer,"Thank you, P'Li. For everything.",12,3,38
P'Li,Of course. [Prepares to leave.],12,3,38
Zaheer,I want you to know: [Stands.] not one day went by in that prison when I didn't think of you.,12,3,38
P'Li,[Walks up to Zaheer.] The years apart only made my love for you stronger. And deep down I knew you would find a way to get me out. Just like you saved me from becoming that warlord's killing machine when I was a girl. [Tears.] You've shown me what true freedom means.,12,3,38
Zaheer,"And after today, [Clasps his hand with P'Li's.] we'll show the entire world what it means. No more prisons, no more running.",12,3,38
P'Li,"I love you, Zaheer.",12,3,38
Zaheer,I love you too. [Both kiss.],12,3,38
,"Cut to Laghima's Peak with Suyin's airship at the bottom. Tonraq and Suyin seen walking outside, with Lin talking to the Team Avatar on the mouth of the airship.",12,3,38
Lin,[Passes a radio to Korra.] Radio the second you see those airbenders.,12,3,38
Mako,"I will, Chief. Good luck.",12,3,38
,Lin nods to Mako before walking out. Korra hugs Asami.,12,3,38
Asami,"Be careful, Korra.",12,3,38
Korra,You too.,12,3,38
,"Korra hugs Mako, when she lets go, Bolin hugs her, sobbing. Korra walks out of the airship before it takes off.",12,3,38
Tonraq,Korra.,12,3,38
Korra,"Don't worry, Dad. I'll be all right.",12,3,38
Tonraq,[Hugs his daughter.] I just want you to know how proud I am of you. The risk you're taking to save the Air Nation will be remembered for generations.,12,3,38
Korra,"I love you, Dad.",12,3,38
Tonraq,"I love you too, sweetheart.",12,3,38
Korra,"[As her father joins the metalbenders.] And Dad, watch out for Zaheer. He's not very fond of world leaders.",12,3,38
Tonraq,I can handle him. Just stay focused on your mission.,12,3,38
,Tonraq and the metalbenders scale up the mountain until they are obscured from view by the clouds. Korra opens her glider and flies up the mountain. Cut to the Northern Air Temple as the airship approaches. Cut to the interior where Mako and Bolin survey the damage.,12,3,38
Bolin,"Oh, man.",12,3,38
Mako,Must have been some fight.,12,3,38
Korra,"Mako, did you see the airbenders?",12,3,38
Mako,Not yet. We're just arriving. Don't turn yourself over until I get a visual on them.,12,3,38
,"Asami steers the airship to the temple, while Bolin ties the tethering ropes. Both approach the temple to see Ghazan awaiting them.",12,3,38
Ghazan,"This way. [Team Avatar glares at Ghazan with suspicion.] You want the airbenders, or not?",12,3,38
,"Ghazan walks into the temple, which Team Avatar follows. Cut to Korra flying toward Laghima's Peak, where Zaheer and P'Li are waiting.",12,3,38
Zaheer,Drop your staff and surrender yourself. [Korra stands still.] Don't make me come get you.,12,3,38
,"Korra remains defiant and remains still. Cut to the Northern Air Temple where Ghazan leads Team Avatar to the captured airbenders, where Tenzin is chained to the floor and gagged, while the other airbenders are bound up and hooded.",12,3,38
Korra,"Mako, what's going on?",12,3,38
Mako,They're here. And so is the lavabender.,12,3,38
Korra,Tell Ghazan to let the airbenders go.,12,3,38
Zaheer,Not 'til you turn yourself over. This isn't a negotiation. [To Ghazan.] Wipe them out!,12,3,38
Korra,No! Wait. I'm coming.,12,3,38
Zaheer,[As P'Li walks to Korra.] Stand down.,12,3,38
,"P'Li and Korra walk up to each other. Korra drops her staff and radio, while P'Li cuffs her wrists and ankles.",12,3,38
P'Li,Don't bother trying to metalbend out of these: they're platinum.,12,3,38
,P'Li pushes Korra toward Zaheer. Cut to the temple.,12,3,38
Zaheer,We have her.,12,3,38
,"Ghazan gestures to Team Avatar, who run toward Tenzin. Tenzin shakes his head.",12,3,38
Asami,"It's okay, Tenzin. We're about to get you out of here.",12,3,38
,"Mako walks up to the airbenders, only to see them collapse into a pool of water and Ming-Hua seated among the decoys. Ming-Hua rushes to attack Team Avatar, which Mako blocks the attack with fire.",12,3,38
Mako,"Korra, it was a trick! They're not here. Don't turn yourself over!",12,3,38
Korra,We had a deal!,12,3,38
,"Korra struggles against her restraints and airbends with her feet, separating Zaheer and P'Li. Cut to Lin on the mountainside.",12,3,38
Mako,"Chief, get Korra out of there. Now!",12,3,38
Lin,Go! Go!,12,3,38
,"The metalbenders ascend the mountain. Cut to the peak where Korra firebends and earthbends at Zaheer, who dodges all the attacks. Korra tries to regain her ground, but is stopped by her shackles. Zaheer airbends her off her feet and slams her down with an air blast. Cut back to the mountainside where the metalbenders reach the peak, engaging P'Li.",12,3,38
P'Li,Get the Avatar on the airship. I'll deal with them.,12,3,38
,"P'Li runs forward directs a combustion beam at the metalbenders. Lin manages to dodge the attack, but two metalbenders were thrown off the peak and fire a cable to ascend the peak again. Lin dodges another combustion beam and sends two earth slabs to P'Li. Suyin joins in a sends another slab. P'Li destroys a slab with combustion and avoids the other two. Cut to the airship where Zaheer pushes Korra into the airship. Tonraq climbs up the airship and attacks Zaheer. Korra dodges the attack and falls off the airship. Tonraq catches Korra with waterbending and throws her toward Zaheer, where she sends a point-blank fire kick. Zaheer protects himself with airbending, but is thrown back. Tonraq cuts the tethering ropes with his water whips, causing the airship to fly off.",12,3,38
Tonraq,"Nowhere to go, Zaheer!",12,3,38
,"Tonraq directs his whips to Zaheer, changing the scene to the Northern Air Temple where Ming-Hua scales the walls, landing next to Ghazan. Ghazan directs lava to Bolin, who blocks with an earth column. Mako runs up and firebends, while Asami tends to Tenzin.",12,3,38
Asami,Where're the airbenders?,12,3,38
Tenzin,I don't know. Zaheer moved them out of the temple.,12,3,38
,"Mako firebends at Ming-Hua, who stops the attack with her water arms.",12,3,38
Ming-Hua,Won't you just bury them already?,12,3,38
,"Ghazan leaps forward, lavabending a large portion of the floor, before spreading it across the room. As they exit, Ghazan lavabends the exit path. Asami looks on in fear, as she picks Tenzin's shackles with her hairpin.",12,3,38
Asami,"Come on. [Punches the hairpin, freeing Tenzin before supporting him.] We have to get to the airship.",12,3,38
Bolin,Not gonna happen. The exit's blocked.,12,3,38
,"Bolin bends the tiles beneath, forming a barricade to stop the lava flow. A pillar collapses. Tenzin groans, prompting Mako to run up and support him.",12,3,38
Asami,Where's Oogi?,12,3,38
Tenzin,"Gone. All the bison got scared off during the attack. But, I think I know another way out. Bolin, can you get us to that wall?",12,3,38
Bolin,On it!,12,3,38
,"Bolin bends the wall behind them. Cut to the temple exterior, where Ghazan lavabends the entire exit path before taking over Suyin's airship with Ming-Hua.

Tenzin,Through there.,12,3,38

Bolin,"[Getting uncomfortable.] Is it just me, or is it uh, getting really warm in here? [Notices approaching lava.] Oh, this is not good. [Blocks the lava flow.] Let's move it, people!",12,3,38
,"Cut to Laghima's Peak with P'Li bombards the metalbenders out. Korra kicks a boulder to Zaheer while Tonraq whips the water. Zaheer airbends the assault and creates a wind gust to Tonraq. He dodges, waterbends the water to attack Zaheer. The boulder flew toward Zaheer, but he easily dodges and punches some air gusts to Tonraq until he falls down. Korra stands up, creating some earth cracks which the airbender dodges. Tonraq bends an ice spear on his forearm, with his remaining water supply, and attempts to stab Zaheer, who dodges his attack and manages to ensnare Tonraq in a small tornado.",12,3,38

Suyin,Lin. No.,12,3,38

,"Lin leaps up the slope to avoid P'Li's combustion beam before retaliating with an earth slap. P'Li destroys the slab while Suyin glances out looking for the right moment. Lin sends two earth slabs to P'Li, who dodges and retaliates with combustion beams. Lin dodges the attack and bends an earth wall to protect herself from another beam, but is knocked toward the edge. Lin props herself up. While P'Li prepares to finish Lin, Suyin runs out of her cover and bends her armor toward P'Li's head, containing the blast. Cut to Zaheer who turns back in horror, staring at the resulting explosion.",12,3,38
Zaheer,[Shocked.] P'Li!,12,3,38
,"Zaheer looks at the fight sadly, while Korra, seizing the moment to distraction, firebends at Zaheer. Zaheer dodges the attack and sends an air blast to Korra, knocking her out.

Suyin,"It's over, Zaheer.",12,3,38
Zaheer,Let go your earthly tether.,12,3,38

Mako,Now what?,12,3,38
,The group turns back to see the lava approaching the tunnel. Bolin walks toward the lava and stretches out his hands.,12,3,38
Mako,Bolin!,12,3,38
,"As Bolin groans, the lava flies above him. He brings his hands together, pushing the lava back and solidifying it.",12,3,38
Tenzin,Incredible.,12,3,38
Mako,[Amazed.] You're a lavabender.,12,3,38
Bolin,I know. I just found out.,12,3,38
Kai,"[Flies toward the hole atop a baby bison.] Hey, you guys need a lift?",12,3,38
Tenzin,Kai. You're all right.,12,3,38
Kai,More or less. Everyone hop on.,12,3,38
,"Tenzin climbs onto the bison first, followed by Asami. Mako follows suit, causing the bison to lose altitude. As Bolin climbs onto Lefty, it groans from the impact. The bison subsequently leaves the temple. Tenzin looks back sadly as the temple begins to collapse. Cut to the mountain foot where Kuvira bandages Tonraq.",12,3,38
Tonraq,"I owe you my life. Thank you, Captain.",12,3,38
Kuvira,"You can call me, Kuvira.",12,3,38
,"Cut to a far shot of the temporary camp, where everyone hears Bolin's bird calls. Suyin stands up and points in the direction of the calls. Lefty flies toward the camp, landing heavily and tossing Bolin off mount. Suyin and Lin rush forward to help Team Avatar.",12,3,38
Kai,"Hey everybody, there's something I got to tell you.",12,3,38
Lin,How did you guys make it out of the temple alive?,12,3,38
Mako,"It was all Bolin. I thought we were done for, then out of nowhere, he lavabends.",12,3,38
Suyin,I knew you had the potential for something big. You just had to believe in yourself.,12,3,38
Bolin,"You're right. Being moments from death was a pretty good motivator too. Of course, we would have never made it back with Kai.",12,3,38
Kai,Glad I could help. So anyway-,12,3,38
Tenzin,Did Zaheer get away with Korra?,12,3,38
Lin,I'm afraid so.,12,3,38
Suyin,"Apparently, he can fly now.",12,3,38
Tenzin,What?,12,3,38
Asami,How?,12,3,38
Bolin,Are you sure?,12,3,38
Lin,I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it for myself.,12,3,38
Tenzin,I've heard the legends about Guru Laghima's ability to fly. I'd never imagine they were true.,12,3,38
Tonraq,So what's our next move?,12,3,38
Kai,I have an idea.,12,3,38
Lin,"Not right now, kid! We need to figure out where Zaheer took Korra.",12,3,38
Tenzin,And find the airbenders.,12,3,38
Kai,"[Irritated.] That's what I've been trying to tell you. [Everyone looks at him as he speaks.] I know where the airbenders are, and I bet it's where Korra is too.",12,3,38
Mako,"Well, why didn't you say something? [Kai glares at him in irritation, before sighing.]",12,3,38
Tenzin,Where are they? How did you find them?,12,3,38
Kai,"After I got blasted out the sky, I woke up on the side of the mountain, [Lefty walks up to him.] where this little fellow found me. I tried to sneak back into the temple, to see if I could rescue anyone, and that's when I saw the airship leaving. I followed it into some caves a few miles from here. The giant lady and some people put the airbenders into the caves.",12,3,38
Lin,Was it Ghazan and Ming-Hua?,12,3,38
Kai,"No, there were four more of them. They didn't look familiar.",12,3,38
Mako,Must be more Red Lotus members than we thought.,12,3,38
Kai,"I couldn't fight them on my own, so I came back here, hoping you guys would show up.",12,3,38
Lin,We need to get to those caves.,12,3,38
Kai,How? I don't think we can all fit on my bison.,12,3,38
,A shadow flies above the group. The group looks up to see Oogi.,12,3,38

Mako,"[To Kai who had just mounted atop Lefty.] Hey. Um, I appreciate you coming back for us. Sorry for ever giving you a hard time.",12,3,38
Kai,That's okay. I probably deserved it.,12,3,38
Mako,"Yeah, you kind of did.",12,3,38
,"Cut to the mountain range as Oogi follows Lefty. Cut to the Red Lotus' hideout, where Zaheer is seated cross-legged while levitating. Ming-Hua and Ghazan approach him.",12,3,38
Ming-Hua,Why didn't you ever tell us you could fly?,12,3,38
Zaheer,I wasn't sure I could. Only one other airbender in history had the ability.,12,3,38
Ghazan,[Looks underneath Zaheer.] How did you figure out how to do it?,12,3,38
Zaheer,I found true freedom. I am no longer bound to this earth by worldly desires. I have entered the void.,12,3,38
Ming-Hua,[Glares at Ghazan.] Where's P'Li?,12,3,38
Zaheer,[Returns to the floor.] She sacrificed her life for our cause. Now let's make sure it wasn't in vain.,12,3,38

Zaheer,I understand your grief. I also lost someone I loved today. But your pain will soon be over. [To the members.] Bring the poison.,12,3,38
,"Two Red Lotus members walk forward, causing Korra to gasp in fear. One member bends out the poison, which is a silvery-black liquid. Cut to Korra who looks on in horror.",12,3,38
,Cut to credits.,12,3,38
,"The scene opens to the cave where the Red Lotus held Korra as captive, chained and suspended in the middle of the cave with Zaheer and company standing in front of her on a viewing platform. Korra tries to break free of her chains.",13,3,39
Korra,"[To Red Lotus; enraged.] When I get out of here, none of you will survive!",13,3,39
Zaheer,"You won't get out, unless the Metal Clan has taught you a way to bend platinum. [View focuses to a Red Lotus member suspending the poison in mid-air.] Once we administer this poison, your body will naturally react, forcing you into the Avatar State in an effort to keep you alive. Sadly for you, you'll be entering it for the last time.",13,3,39
Korra,[Switch to a close up of a desperate Korra.] No! The Avatar Cycle.,13,3,39
Zaheer,"[Calmly.] Yes. When we dispatch you in the Avatar State, the cycle will end. [Camera zooms out to a full shot of the platform to include Ming-Hua and Ghazan.] So we lucky few, this band of brothers and sisters in anarchy, are witnessing the beginning of an era of true freedom. Together, we will forge a world without kings and queens, without borders or nations, where Man's only allegiance is to himself and those he loves. We will return to the true balance of natural order. And though you will never again be reborn, your name will echo throughout history: Korra, the last Avatar.",13,3,39
,"The scene zooms out, revealing Jinora's astral projection eavesdropping on the conversation. Jinora returns to her body, which was left behind with the other airbenders who are all chained to the floor of a cave.",13,3,39
Opal,Did you find any way to escape?,13,3,39
Jinora,"No. Not yet. But don't worry, we'll find a way out soon.",13,3,39
Daw,They might not make it that long. [Bumi and Kya are shown lying unconscious.],13,3,39
Ikki,"Korra will come and save us, right?",13,3,39
Jinora,I think we're gonna have to do this on our own.,13,3,39
,The group turns back to see two Red Lotus guards securing the entrance. Cut back to Zaheer's cave.,13,3,39
Zaheer,Administer the poison.,13,3,39
,"The sentry bends the poison, splitting it into four portions and attaches a portion to each limb. He metalbends, causing the poison to diffuse into Korra's skin. Throughout the administration, Korra screams in agony and her eyes begin to glow momentarily.",13,3,39
Zaheer,"Get ready. As soon as she's in the Avatar State, take her out.",13,3,39
,"Ming-Hua bends the tips of her water arms into ice, while Ghazan bends the floor beneath Korra into lava. Korra continues resisting the poison, entering and exiting the Avatar State.",13,3,39
Ghazan,Wait. Why isn't she staying in the Avatar State?,13,3,39
Zaheer,Give it time. She can't resist for long.,13,3,39
,Cut to Lefty and Oogi flying across the mountain range.,13,3,39

Amon,"I told you, Korra. [Zaheer's face cracks up and falls off, revealing Amon's mask beneath the skin.] The world doesn't need you anymore.",13,3,39
Unalaq,"[Ghazan's head turns 360 degrees, changing into that of Unalaq's.] The time of the Avatar is over, Korra. Give up.",13,3,39
Vaatu,"[Ming-Hua morphs into Vaatu.] You're too weak to resist, and I'm stronger than ever. There's no use fighting. Let go.",13,3,39
"Amon, Unalaq, and Vaatu",Let go. Let go. Let go.,13,3,39

,"The sentry glances at his partner, who shrugs, before he brings the water to the airbenders. Jinora airbends at the sentry, covering his face with his robes, which causes the keys to fall off. Meelo airbends, throwing the keys to Opal, who catches and hides it out of view.",13,3,39
Red Lotus sentry #1,"Oh, so you just called me over to attack me? Fine! Now nobody gets any water. [Drinks from the skin and walks out.] I don't know how we ended up in daycare while everyone else gets to watch the Avatar being destroyed. I can hold a bowl of poison!",13,3,39
,Opal takes the keys and unlocks her cuffs.,13,3,39
Red Lotus sentry #2,Hey! What do you think you're doing?!,13,3,39
,"Before the sentry can act, he is knocked out cold by a rock. Cut to the attacker, which reveals to be Team Avatar. The other sentry bends two rocks at the team, who were protected by Suyin's bent wall. When the attack stops, Asami leaps over the wall and stuns the sentry.",13,3,39
Opal,Mom!,13,3,39

Kai,"Why? Just because I was blown out of the sky, and fell hundreds of feet down a cliff? Don't you know it takes more than that to get rid of me? [Grins, while Jinora nudges him on the shoulder.]",13,3,39
Lin,We have to get these two out of here now. They don't look so good.,13,3,39
Bumi,"What are you talking about? I feel great! [Slumps down, coughing weakly.]",13,3,39

Ghazan erupts lava toward Korra, who swings the chain around her arm before directing the lava flow with airbending back to Ghazan, causing him to retreat to avoid the lava. Korra rips off the chains on her legs and airbends herself away before propelling herself with firebending to rip off the final chain.

,"Korra reaches out to her father, but faints, causing tears to well up on Tonraq's eyes. Zaheer cackles.",13,3,39
Lin,What are you laughing about?,13,3,39
Zaheer,You're too late! The poison has been in her system too long. The Red Lotus has won!,13,3,39
Jinora,[To Suyin.] You can save her! The poison is metallic!,13,3,39
,"Suyin runs to Korra and holds her by the shoulder and forehead. She metalbends and pulls the poison from Korra's limbs, while everyone looks on in; worried. Suyin pulls the poison out of Korra's mouth, causing her to cough, before tossing the poison aside.",13,3,39
Korra,Dad. You're alive.,13,3,39
Tonraq,I'm here for you. [Hugs his daughter.] I'm never gonna let you go.,13,3,39
Zaheer,No! No! You don't understand! The revolution has already begun. Chaos is the natural order of- [Bolin gags him with a sock.],13,3,39
Bolin,"[To Opal.] See what I did there? I put a sock in him, literally.",13,3,39
Opal,Classic Bolin.,13,3,39
Bolin,I do what I do.,13,3,39
,"Cut to a far shot of the entire group, before fading out and switching to Air Temple Island. Cut to the interior, where Asami takes a hairpin from her lips and inserts it into Korra's bunned hair.",13,3,39
Asami,There you go. All fixed up for a formal Avatar appearance. [Passes Korra a mirror.] Take a look.,13,3,39
Korra,[Downcast.] It's great. Thanks.,13,3,39
Asami,"[Side shot, revealing Korra in a wheelchair.] You know, nobody expects you to bounce back right away. It's only been two weeks. You need time to heal. [Korra glances at her expressionlessly; Asami holds her hand.] I want you to know that I'm here for you. If you ever want to talk, or, anything. But let's just try to enjoy this today; for Jinora.",13,3,39
Korra,"You're right. [Breathes deeply.] Okay, let's go.",13,3,39
,"Asami wheels Korra out of her room. Cut to the outside where airbenders are entering a building up a flight of stairs. Asami wheels Korra in front of a crowd, and Lord Zuko bows to her. Korra nods back. Her mother runs forward to hug her.",13,3,39
Tonraq,"[Walks up.] You look beautiful, sweetie. [Kisses Korra on the forehead.]",13,3,39
Tenzin,"You're looking stronger everyday, Korra.",13,3,39
Raiko,"I'd like to officially welcome you back to Republic City. I know that the last time we saw each other, it didn't end on the best terms. But I want to thank you for taking down those Red Lotus terrorists.",13,3,39
Asami,We should go inside.,13,3,39
Ikki,[Runs beside Asami.] I-I can help.,13,3,39
Meelo,"[Leaps onto Korra.] I want to ride with Korra. [Korra holds on to Meelo, smiling.] Jinora's already inside. Smells like shoe trees.",13,3,39
Ikki,"[As Asami wheels Korra to the foot of the stairs.] Sandalwood, Meelo.",13,3,39
Lin,"I got this. [Bends the floor around them; puts a hand on Korra's shoulder.] Hang in there, kid. [Moves the group up the stairs.]",13,3,39
Raiko,She's not looking good.,13,3,39
Tonraq,Neither would you if you'd gone through what she had.,13,3,39
Tenzin,She'll be fine. She just needs time to heal. The poison took a great toll.,13,3,39
Raiko,"Of course. I'm just saying, with the Earth Kingdom in complete disarray since the loss of the Queen ...",13,3,39
Zuko,"And even with Zaheer locked up again, we still don't know how many Red Lotus members might be out there, hiding.",13,3,39
Raiko,"Exactly. With the world getting more and more dangerous, we need the Avatar now more than ever. Who will protect us while she's in a wheelchair?",13,3,39
,"Cut to the ceremonial hall where incense sticks are burning. Air Acolytes and many guests are seated, witnessing the ceremony, while airbenders stand on the stage. Jinora is in the middle, wearing a hood.",13,3,39
Tenzin,"Jinora, come forward. [Jinora bows and walks forward before kneeling.] Today, we welcome the first airbending master in a generation. And I couldn't be more proud of my daughter. [Jinora looks up and smiles.] When the existence of our people was threatened, when the Avatar's life hung in the balance, Jinora never gave up hope. Thanks to her leadership, I see a very bright future for the Air Nation. Of course, there would be no Air Nation without Avatar Korra: she opened the portals and somehow the world began anew for us. And she was even willing to lay down her own life in order to protect ours. There's no way we can ever repay her for all she's done. But we can follow her example of service and sacrifice. So while she recuperates, the Air Nation will reclaim its nomadic roots and roam the earth. [Pan to the airbenders, revealing Ryu within the group.] But unlike our ancestors, we will serve people of all nations, working wherever there is corruption and discord to restore balance and peace. Avatar Korra, I vow that we will do everything in our power to follow in your footsteps and bring harmony to the world. [Tenzin bows to Korra, who bows back.] Now, let us anoint the master who will help lead us in our new path.",13,3,39
,"Tenzin removes Jinora's hood, revealing her tattoos. Jinora removes the coat and stands up. The airbenders bend the smoke from the burning incense sticks, sounding the wind chimes around the hall. Jinora hugs her father. The audience claps while a tear rolls down Korra's cheek.",13,3,39
,Cut to credits.,13,3,39
,"The final shot of the narration, a shot of Central City Station with a large crowd around the entrance, switches from black and white to color as the narration ends.",1,4,40
Raiko,"[Addressing the crowd.] And of course, my biggest thanks goes to Asami Sato and Future Industries. She brought our old central terminal into the modern era. Ladies and gentlemen, the world is entering a new age of peace and prosperity. Soon, Prince Wu will take his rightful place on the Earth Kingdom throne. [Cut to a shot of Wu striking a pose for a reporter about to take a photograph.] And thanks to our updated rail system, Republic City and the Earth Kingdom will be united like never before!",1,4,40
,"The crowd applauds as Raiko and Asami cut the ribbon to ceremoniously open the new station. Fade to a shot of Asami talking to a reporter, who is being approached by Prince Wu.",1,4,40
Wu,"Hey there! Asami, right? Great train house. Maybe you can give me a personal tour sometime, what do you say?",1,4,40
Asami,"[Annoyed.] I do like the idea of putting you on a train and sending you far, far away.",1,4,40
Wu,"[Chuckles.] That's ... that's funny. I like funny dames. Maybe I should introduce myself. I'm Prince Wu, future king.",1,4,40
Asami,Yeah ... I'm aware of who you are.,1,4,40
Wu,"Don't let my reputation intimidate you. I'm still human just like everyone else. Only more human, like, extra human, or, hmm, superhuman.",1,4,40
Asami,[With a questioning look on her face.] Superhuman?,1,4,40
Wu,"So, what do you say? Can I show you a low-key night out with a superhuman soon-to-be king?",1,4,40
,"He wiggles his eyebrows, with Asami giving him an even weirder look. Mako interrupts them.",1,4,40
Mako,Prince Wu! President Raiko has some really important ... king stuff to talk to you about.,1,4,40
Wu,[Disappointed.] Now? [Sighs.] Fine. [To Asami.] Think over the offer. [Blows her a kiss-hand and walks off.] I'll be back. [ Asami rolls her eyes.],1,4,40
Mako,"He's a real charmer, huh?",1,4,40
Asami,He's ... something. How can you stand being his bodyguard?,1,4,40
Mako,"Well, I just remind myself that once he's on the throne, I go back to being a detective.",1,4,40
Asami,And that works?,1,4,40
Mako,"[Sarcastically.] I also go home, and smash my head into the wall for an hour, you know, just to get the stress out.",1,4,40
Asami,"[Laughs lightly.] It's good to see you, Mako. It's been too long. You hear from Bolin lately?",1,4,40
Mako,"I haven't talked to him for a while, but he's coming in a few days for the coronation. And Beifong told me that Korra is getting in tonight.",1,4,40
Asami,"I can't wait to see her. [Cut to a close-up.] It's going to be weird, having the old Team Avatar back in the city after all these years.",1,4,40
,"Cut to Tenzin, Prince Wu, President Raiko and Lin Beifong.",1,4,40
Tenzin,"After your coronation, the United Forces will escort you to Ba Sing Se.",1,4,40
Wu,Right. About that. Are we all positive that the Earth Kingdom is safe enough for me to return? I don't have to remind everyone what happened to my great-aunt three years ago?! [He starts imitating Hou-Ting suffocating.] May she rest in peace.,1,4,40
Raiko,"Prince Wu, I assure you, Kuvira has the Earth Kingdom pretty much stabilized at this point.",1,4,40
Wu,"[Skeptically.] Uh ... define ""pretty much"".",1,4,40
Tenzin,"Well, the roving bandits have mostly been dispersed.",1,4,40
Wu,Mostly?,1,4,40
Lin,Don't worry kid. The chances of you being assassinated are almost zero.,1,4,40
Wu,Almost?,1,4,40
,"A small village of the State of Yi in the Earth Kingdom is shown. A villager is seen sweeping the street when a jeep nearly runs him down. After it stops, three bandits jump out and walk into a shop.",1,4,40
Shopkeeper,Get out of here! We don't have anything left.,1,4,40
,"One of the bandits earthbends a fissure toward the counter, destroying it and revealing several hidden sacks of goods. The bandits take them.",1,4,40
Bandit #1,Now you don't have anything left.,1,4,40
,"They proceed to load the stolen stuff into their jeep. Hearing a noise, they look up to see Lefty grumbling far above them. Opal and Kai, who are standing on his back wearing wingsuits, jump down to engage them. The bandits gasp and make a run for it, but they are quickly overtaken by the airbenders. Kai blasts air at the front of the jeep, stopping it in its tracks and launching the bandits out. Opal catches them with a gust of air, and the airbenders tie the bandits up.",1,4,40
Kai,"It's safe to come out, everyone! The airbenders are here.",1,4,40
,The governor comes running out of a building toward Opal and Kai.,1,4,40
Governor,You finally made it! So where are the rest of you?,1,4,40
Opal,"Actually, it's just the two of us, but we're going to do everything we can to help. I'm Opal, and this is Kai.",1,4,40
Kai,It's nice to meet you.,1,4,40
Governor,"[Shocked and upset.] What? I called Master Tenzin because my state has been under siege by bandits for months. They blocked all the roads, cut off our supply lines, and all he sent is you two kids?",1,4,40
Kai,"Hey, us two kids just took care of those three guys for you.",1,4,40
Governor,There are hundreds more where they came from. My citizens are going hungry. Our entire state is on the brink of collapse.,1,4,40
Opal,"Unfortunately, the Air Nation is spread thin right now. We're all you have.",1,4,40
,Governor lets his head hang in disappointment. Cut to a train riding a maglev rail. It makes two turns before heading into a mountain range.,1,4,40
Bolin,We just got some good news. [Salutes Baatar Jr.] Two more Earth Kingdom states have agreed to join us.,1,4,40
Baatar Jr.,"Excellent! Thank you, Bolin. [Takes a folder from Bolin and turns to Kuvira, who is looking at a map.] We're ninety percent there, Kuvira.",1,4,40
Varrick,"[Slaps knee enthusiastically.] That's great! Zhu Li, dish out some of that special celebration tea!",1,4,40
,Zhu Li salutes Varrick and goes off to get the tea. Kuvira metalbends two cutouts of states onto the map in front of her. Zhu Li offers her tea.,1,4,40
Kuvira,None for me. I won't celebrate until the Earth Kingdom is one hundred percent reunited.,1,4,40
,"The others all put their cups back onto their saucers, and Bolin spits his tea back into his cup. The train makes a sudden stop and everyone staggers, spilling their tea onto their clothes. Kuvira stays perfectly still, despite facing backward. She only moves when the train comes to a dead stop. As the others try to mop the tea out of their clothes, the driver walks up to Kuvira and salutes her.",1,4,40
Kuvira,Why have we stopped?,1,4,40
Driver,Apologies. There are rocks on the tracks. It's most likely bandits. We're sending troops to handle the situation.,1,4,40
Kuvira,Call them off. I will take care of the bandits myself.,1,4,40
,"Cut to a wide shot of the train, showing a pile of rocks in front of it. Kuvira climbs to the top of one of the carts and waits. She spots the bandits on the crest of the ridge to her left. They jump down, surfing on rocks while also earthbending boulders at Kuvira, who effortlessly dodges them and starts shooting slabs of metal at them, which she uses to either blind the bandits or bind their limbs together. After easily defeating every bandit, she metalbends their bonds further to pile them together. Cut to all of the bandits blinded with a slab of metal and attached to the maglev rail by their wrist bonds. Kuvira removes all of their blindfolds and bends them back into her backpack.",1,4,40
Female bandit #1,You're ... Kuvira.,1,4,40
Kuvira,"And you're the bandits who have been causing chaos where I'm trying to establish order, aren't you?",1,4,40
Female bandit #1,"[Nearly crying.] We're sorry, we didn't know this was your train and ...",1,4,40
,"Kuvira bends a metal band over her mouth, silencing her.",1,4,40
Kuvira,[Angry.] Don't talk over me! [Drops the slab over the bandit's mouth.],1,4,40
Male bandit #1,"Please, take mercy on us!",1,4,40
Kuvira,"Stop groveling as if this is the worst day of your life. This ... is a good day. I'm going to give you all the opportunity to rehabilitate yourselves, and become productive members of your nation. Right now, you're lost, but pledge your loyalty to me, and I'll give you a new purpose in your lives. Of course, if you don't want to join, you could always stay right here. Hopefully, someone saves you before the next train speeds through, but I wouldn't count on it.",1,4,40
Male bandit #1,"No, we'll join. Don't leave us here.",1,4,40
Female bandit #1,"We pledge our loyalty to you, Great Uniter.",1,4,40
,"Shot focuses on Kuvira again, who smiles out of the bandits' view. Fade to a hotel in Republic City with jazzy music playing in the background. Outside, there is a small crowd. Inside, two men open up the door for Prince Wu and Mako. Wu is spinning his cane around his arm, before casually catching it.",1,4,40
Mako,I don't know why we're leaving so early if you're just getting a haircut. The dinner at Air Temple Island isn't until later tonight.,1,4,40
Wu,"Because I'm not just getting a haircut, it's a spa day! We're talking minimum four hours.",1,4,40
Mako,Are you kidding me? [Pushes the button to call an elevator.] What are you having done that takes four hours?,1,4,40
Wu,"A rejuvenating tea-leaf skin wrap. Have you ever gotten one of those, Mako?",1,4,40
Mako,"Yeah, I'm ... not interested.",1,4,40
Wu,"[Chuckles.] You will be. [Elevator doors close. He continues on the ground floor.] So while your hands soak in a bubbling milk-bath, your feet are in a tub full of these little sucker-fish that literally eat your calluses away. Gobble them right up! Crazy, huh?",1,4,40
Mako,That's disgusting!,1,4,40
Wu,"Then, they scrape your skin with blocks of sea-salt and lube you up with seaweed-infused aloe, wrap you in tea leaves, put you in a hot box for four hours, and bam! You're done! [He looks through the door at the crowd, half of which is cheering for him, the other half is booing him.] Mako, look at all my fans! They must be in town for my coronation.",1,4,40
Mako,[Doubtful.] I don't know if all those people are your fans.,1,4,40
,"Two more men open the doors for them as they walk outside. Wu does some poses for the cameraman waiting for him, while he goes up to two of his fans and takes a picture with them. Mako sees a few shady figures approaching, all with a hand behind their backs.",1,4,40
Mako,"[Acting on his suspicion.] Wu, we have to get you out of here! [Lifts the prince from the arms of his fangirls and into the limo as it is being struck by pies. Shouts to the driver.] Go! Go!",1,4,40
,The limousine takes off while another pie hits it.,1,4,40
Wu,What just happened out there?,1,4,40
Mako,I think those were Kuvira's supporters in the crowd.,1,4,40
Wu,"[Notices a stain on his belly.] Oh no! Mako, I've been hit! It's a gusher!",1,4,40
Mako,[Calmly and dryly.] That's not blood. It's strawberry pie.,1,4,40
Wu,"[Tastes it.] Oh. Yeah, you're right. [Puts a hand on Mako's shoulder.] But that was close. I don't know what would have happened if you weren't there.",1,4,40
Mako,You would have been hit by a pie. It's really not that big of a deal.,1,4,40
Wu,Or I could have been killed! I don't know what I'd ever do without you! Wait a second. Did you say strawberry pie? [Grabs throat.] I'm allergic to strawberries! [Falls onto his knees.] I don't think I can breathe! Get me to the hospital! Wu down!,1,4,40
Mako,[Looks over to Wu with annoyance.] You're allergic to bee stings!,1,4,40
Wu,"[Relaxes.] Oh. Yeah, you're right. [Sits on the floor and rests his elbow on Mako's knee; Mako does not look pleased.] I always get those two mixed up.",1,4,40
,"Cut to a scene of Kai and Opal feeding Lefty, as a train blares its horn in the distance.",1,4,40
Kai,Look! A train made it through!,1,4,40
Opal,Maybe they brought food and supplies!,1,4,40
,"Cut to the town, where a large crowd has gathered on the platform. Kai and Opal make it to the front, just as the doors open and Kuvira's men exit the train, with Bolin being one of them.",1,4,40
Kai,"Hey, what's your boyfriend doing here?",1,4,40
Opal,"If he's here, he must be with Kuvira and my brother. This isn't going to be good.",1,4,40
Kai,[Shouts.] Bolin!,1,4,40
Bolin,"[Enthusiastically.] Kai! [They give each other a hug.] Wow, you are a lot heavier than you used to be. You're really growing up.",1,4,40
Kai,What's up with your new hair? You look like a stiff.,1,4,40
Bolin,"[Annoyed.] Hey, Kuvira says it makes me look intelligent and professional.",1,4,40
Opal,"[Ruffles up Bolin's hair, back to its original design.] Don't believe everything she says.",1,4,40
Bolin,"Opal, I can't believe you're here too! [Gives her a hug.] I missed you so much.",1,4,40
Opal,I missed you too.,1,4,40
Baatar Jr.,"Look who it is. It's good to see you again, little sister.",1,4,40
Kuvira,What a wonderful surprise. A happy reunion for my favorite couple.,1,4,40
Baatar Jr.,[Inquisitively and cordially.] How's Mom doing?,1,4,40
Opal,[Slightly angry toward her brother.] Like you care. She still hasn't forgiven you.,1,4,40
Baatar Jr.,"You know, for someone who claims to be so enlightened, Mom can really hold a grudge.",1,4,40
Opal,I guess when her son betrays her ...,1,4,40
Kuvira,"[Interrupts the arguing siblings.] Please, Opal, we're not here to bicker with you about something that happened three years ago. We're here to help this town, just like you.",1,4,40
Opal,[Even more hostile toward Kuvira.] I've heard how you help towns. By conquering them.,1,4,40
Kuvira,"I know the rumors about me can be pretty nasty, but I am giving everyone in this nation a better future. And with Bolin's help, and my fiancé's ideas, we're laying the ground work for the people to achieve their own greatness.",1,4,40
Opal,[Surprised.] Your fiancé?,1,4,40
Kuvira,You haven't heard? [Baatar Jr. and Kuvira look at each other.] Your brother and I are getting married.,1,4,40
Bolin,"[Awkwardly.] Isn't that great, sweetie?",1,4,40
,Kai slides away as Kuvira walks up to Opal and puts a hand on her shoulder.,1,4,40
Kuvira,"I know things got heated with your family when Baatar and I left Zaofu, but don't you think it's time to forgive and forget?",1,4,40
,[Governor interrupts them.] What are you doing here? [Shot cuts to him standing in front of his people.],1,4,40
Kuvira,"[Turns to address him directly.] Hello, governor. I was wondering if you and I could talk privately.",1,4,40
,"A brief exterior shot of the train is shown, before it cuts to the inside, where the governor is sitting at a table and Kuvira is looking out the window.",1,4,40
Kuvira,"So, have you had time to rethink my generous offer?",1,4,40
Governor,Generous? You want to take everything. How is that generous?,1,4,40
Kuvira,"Governor, your state has been overrun by bandits. They have you outnumbered and outsupplied. The question's not if they'll take over; it's when. Unless you sign our deal. Agree to the terms, and you'll have the full force of my army backing you. You will remain in charge, just under my supervision. I will save your life, and the lives of your citizens. I think that's pretty generous.",1,4,40
Governor,"[Slams the contract and jar of ink from the table and stands up.] I know how you manipulate states, and force them to join up under you. I know the only reason you want this region is because it is rich in ore. [View cuts briefly to Kuvira, who is surveying the governor with thin eyes, unimpressed at his outburst.] They might call you ""The Great Uniter"", but you're destroying everything! I'll never turn the great state of Yi over to you!",1,4,40
Kuvira,"[Angrily advancing on the governor.] You have a lot of pride, but it cannot protect your people. [The governor sinks into his chair, while Kuvira stands over him, an arm on his chair, berating him.] Your pride will not stop the hordes as your city crumbles to the ground. And your pride will certainly not feed your hungry when all that is left is rubble!",1,4,40
Governor,[Obviously insulted.] Leave! Get out of my state!,1,4,40
Kuvira,"You will perish, unless you take my generous offer.",1,4,40
,"Cut to the exterior of the train. The small group outside the train door watches as the governor storms off in a rage. As they watch him go, Kuvira appears at the door.",1,4,40
Kuvira,It's time to go. We're not wanted here.,1,4,40
Bolin,[Surprised.] What happened?,1,4,40
Kuvira,"It appears we can't make a deal right now. [Kuvira makes as though she would walk on, but moves back when Kai speaks.]",1,4,40
Kai,Wait! Aren't you guys going to stick around and help?,1,4,40
Kuvira,"[Hands Kai the contract.] Here's the contract. We'll wait at the border for one day. You get the governor to sign it, and you'll have all the help you need. [Goes inside the train again and Baatar Jr. follows her.]",1,4,40
Bolin,[Disappointed.] I guess ... I got to go.,1,4,40
Opal,"[Desperate.] Don't! Please, you can't turn your back on these people!",1,4,40
Bolin,"I'm not! I wanna help, but if the Governor wants us gone, there's ... there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. [He tries to hug Opal, but she angrily pushes him away.] Hey ... Opal, please.",1,4,40
Opal,"[Angry.] Leave, if that's what you're going to do. [Turns around while folding her arms.]",1,4,40
,"Bolin sighs in disappointment, before walking inside with the rest of Kuvira's men.",1,4,40
Kai,"You know, we might not need their help after all. The roads may be impassable, but not the skies. We can use Lefty to fly to all the nearby villages, pick up supplies, and fly back.",1,4,40
Opal,You're right. We can save this town ourselves.,1,4,40
,"An overhead shot of Kai and Opal next to the departing train cuts to a farm with a couple of hippo cows chewing on hay. The shot cuts to a wide shot, showing Opal and Kai talking to a farmer, with a big pile of supplies on Lefty's back.",1,4,40
Farmer,Sorry we couldn't give you more. That's all we could spare.,1,4,40
Opal,"Every little bit helps. Because of you and the other farmers around here, we have more than enough food to feed the town until we can get some reinforcements. [Both Kai and Opal bow to him. He bows back.]",1,4,40
Kai,Thanks!,1,4,40
,A far shot of the farm shows Lefty taking off.,1,4,40
Kai,So ... you and Bolin doing okay?,1,4,40
Opal,[Uncertain.] I don't know. It's really tough having a long distance relationship. And I can't stand that he's working with Kuvira.,1,4,40
Kai,"I can tell. But it does seem like he found his calling, doesn't it? He loves helping people.",1,4,40
Opal,Maybe. It's just ... he's changed a lot since he's been around her.,1,4,40
Kai,He's growing up.,1,4,40
Opal,"I just hope we're not growing apart. [A short pause; more upbeat.] Speaking of long-distance relationships, how are you and Jinora doing?",1,4,40
Kai,"Actually, we're doing fine. [He is interrupted by the whir of an engine.] You hear that?",1,4,40
,A biplane emerges from a cloud below them.,1,4,40
Kai,It's more bandits!,1,4,40
,"A bandit sitting on the wing fires a grappling hook, which catches the net of supplies in the back. Lefty struggles as the plane pulls on the net, tensing the line.",1,4,40
Kai,We're hooked!,1,4,40
,"The bandit ziplines over onto Lefty, while the airbenders try to blast him away with little success. He lands, unfolds a double-bladed sword, and starts cutting the tethers holding down the supplies. Kai manages to land a blow, causing the bandit to lose his balance, leaving him holding onto only the net. A second air blast from Kai's feet connects also, and the bandit falls completely off Lefty's back, although his tether saves him. He swings around Lefty and lands on the other side of the supplies, where he begins attacking Kai again. As they battle, the bandit cuts the last tether, dodges Kai's next air blast, and manages to cut through Kai's wingsuit before the plane pulls the supplies away.",1,4,40
Kai,"[Jumps after the supplies, but misses.] No!",1,4,40
,"As the bandits' plane veers to the left and out of sight, Kai tries to unfold his wingsuit as he falls, discovering that his right wing is sliced through. He spirals out of control toward the ground. Opal sees this and jumps after him, as her wingsuit is still intact. She catches Kai by the arm, and together they form a larger, stable wing. Lefty catches up with them and they gently land on the back of the beast. Cut to the town, where Lefty lands, the airbenders climbing down in front of the eagerly waiting people.",1,4,40
Governor,What happened? Where's all the food?,1,4,40
Opal,We were attacked in mid-air. We lost everything.,1,4,40
Kai,It might be time to make a tough call. [Withdraws Kuvira's contract from his suit and hands it to the governor.],1,4,40
,"The Governor looks over his people, who all look miserable. Seeing no other option, he takes the contract and signs it, handing it back to Kai.",1,4,40
Governor,Here. Tell Kuvira to save my people.,1,4,40
Kai,"For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision.",1,4,40
Governor,[Saddened.] Did I ever really have a choice?,1,4,40
,"A shot of Kai cuts to Air Temple Island at sunset, then to the dining area. Inside it, three groups have formed: Raiko, his wife and Prince Wu; Lin and Mako standing guard and Asami with Tenzin's family.",1,4,40
Meelo,"When Korra gets here, I bet she's not even going to know who I am.",1,4,40
Ikki,Why is that?,1,4,40
Meelo,Because Meelo the boy [Meelo appears against a cheery background with a poorly done crayon drawing.] has turned into Meelo the man!,1,4,40
,"The background changes to one of a dragon and platypus bear, their attires satirizing fighting games. Meelo strikes a ""tough guy"" pose.",1,4,40
Ikki,"[Back in reality, sarcastically.] Right. You're completely unrecognizable.",1,4,40
,"Cut to Prince Wu, Raiko and Buttercup.",1,4,40
Wu,[Chuckles.] You've never had the tea leaf wrap? You have no idea what you're missing. The face massage alone is to die for.,1,4,40
,Cut to Lin and Mako.,1,4,40
Mako,[Annoyed.] Ugh. This coronation cannot come soon enough. I can't wait to go back to being a detective.,1,4,40
Lin,"[Guilty.] Right ... umm ... yeah, about that ...",1,4,40
Mako,[On his guard.] What?,1,4,40
Lin,I don't know how to tell you this ... you're going to Ba Sing Se ... with the prince.,1,4,40
Mako,[Grabs Beifong by the shoulders in disbelief.] No!,1,4,40
Lin,"I tried to get you out of it, but it's over my head. [Mako grunts.] Wu personally asked Raiko. He says he doesn't know what he'd do without you.",1,4,40
Mako,[Distraught.] This can't be happening! I'm not even an Earth Kingdom citizen; I work for the Republic City Police Department.,1,4,40
Lin,"Not anymore. [Both Lin and Mako glance at Raiko, who is laughing with Wu.] You're just a pawn in Raiko's diplomatic game. You can try talking to him, but I don't think he's going to let you quit.",1,4,40
Mako,[Sighs.],1,4,40
,An Air Acolyte walks in.,1,4,40
Acolyte,There's a Southern Water Tribe ship pulling up to the dock!,1,4,40
Children,[Perfectly synchronized.] Korra!,1,4,40
,"They run off, the scene cutting briefly to Tenzin as a smile breaks across his face. Cut back to the village in Yi, where Kuvira's forces have occupied the town. A line of soldiers with metal helmets and faceplates march in. A door in the side of the train opens up, and bipedal mecha tanks exit through the opening. Kuvira's men are handing out food packages to the citizens; one of them gives a little boy an apple. The boy bites into it and smiles up at the man. Other children are playing on one of the mecha tanks. Bolin is handing out food from one of the jeeps. Kuvira steps forward and addresses the gathered crowd.",1,4,40
Kuvira,"The State of Yi is now under the full protection of my army. [Crowd cheers. Kuvira turns to the Governor.] Proclaim your loyalty, if you wish to keep your post.",1,4,40
Governor,"[Angrily.] I pledge my loyalty to you, oh Great Uniter.",1,4,40
,"A banner drops from the gate in front of the town, revealing the logo of Kuvira's army. Opal, watching from the crowd, has a disappointed look on her face, and she looks at Bolin, who spots her in the crowd, excited. She turns away in shame at his perceived betrayal, much to Bolin's disappointment. He continues handing out food packets, though halfheartedly. Cut to the dock at Air Temple Island, where Naga and Tonraq disembark from their ship.",1,4,40
Tenzin,[Walks up to Tonraq; the two men shake hands.] Tonraq. It's good to have you back in the city. And everyone is excited to see the Avatar again.,1,4,40
Tonraq,[Surprised.] What do you mean? Isn't Korra already here?,1,4,40
Tenzin,"No, we thought she was coming with you.",1,4,40
Tonraq,Korra left the South Pole six months ago. She's written me letters. She said she was here in Republic City.,1,4,40
Tenzin,"I assure you, your daughter is not here.",1,4,40
Tonraq,[Worried.] Then where is she?,1,4,40
,Cut to a small arena somewhere in the Earth Kingdom. Korra is engaging an earthbender in a cage fight. She is struck several times by flying stones and knocked backward off her feet.,1,4,40
Korra,[Gets up and taunts her opponent.] Is that all you got?,1,4,40
,"Her opponent keeps attacking her and an agitated Korra attempts to strike back with little success. After an intense exchange of earthbending between the two, the earthbender battling Korra launches herself to the top of the wall and bends a rock Korra shot at her straight back, sending her tumbling into the far wall. For a moment, Korra struggles to rise before collapsing to the ground, unable to get back up. The triumphant earthbender raises her arms victoriously as the crowd above cheers.",1,4,40
Announcer,We have a winner!,1,4,40
,"Cut to a far shot of the arena as the bell rings. The scene fades to later on; the crowd is gone and Korra is sitting in the stands, taking the wrappings off her wrists. The announcer walks up to her.",1,4,40
Announcer,Here. [Throws her a bundle of cash.] For your lackluster participation.,1,4,40
Korra,[Responding indifferently as she picks up the bundle and her bag.] Thanks.,1,4,40
Announcer,"You know, you look very familiar. [Suddenly exclaiming.] Yeah, you ... you kind of look like that Avatar girl!",1,4,40
Korra,[Showing her black eye and blankly responds.] I get that a lot. [Walks off.],1,4,40
,"Scene cuts to an overhead shot of Korra walking away from the announcer around the rim of the ring, while the announcer watches her leave.",1,4,40
Announcer,Whatever happened to her anyway?,1,4,40
Korra,[Walking into shadow.] I wouldn't know.,1,4,40
,Roll credits.,1,4,40
,"As the title card fades into the scene, the view is centered on a mirror, shattered and broken. Through the fractures, a pair of blue eyes, set in a face which is scratched and bruised, are visible. The shot pulls back to reveal Korra looking at her reflection. After a moment, she drops her gaze, as if unable to look at herself. The shot changes to a side shot of Korra; she is standing in a public bathroom of sorts with a slow stream of water running from the sink faucet in front of her. Metalbending the faucet further open, the stream increases, and she pulls a glowing stream of water out of the sink in front of her, holding it to her bruised elbow to heal her wounds. Suddenly, there is a flurry of knocks at the door, making Korra jump and look over her shoulder, on guard.",2,4,41
Man #1,"Hurry up in there! [Shot switches to outside, where the man stands hunched over, waiting.] Come on, I got an emergency situation!",2,4,41
Korra,"[Opening the door and walking away as the man hurriedly enters, groaning.] Knock yourself out. [He slams the door behind her.]",2,4,41
,"Korra walks a little ways before stopping, noticing to revving sound of an engine. Looking up, she sees a car bearing down on her just in time and jumps across the street, somersaulting and running to the other side as the car spins to a stop behind her. Suddenly fatigued, she staggers, holding her hand to her head, and stumbles to the wall of an alley, bracing herself against it. She slowly takes her hand from her head and stares down into the dark alleyway in wonder.",2,4,41
Korra,Huh?,2,4,41
,"A twisting shot drawing closer shows another Korra standing in the alleyway, dressed in the blue of the Water Tribe, a broken chain wrapped around her wrist, and her eyes glowing with the energy of the Avatar State. Her shoulders hunched, her head slightly raised, and her arms limply hanging at her side give her a somewhat inhuman appearance. Still bracing herself against the wall, Korra looks the apparition in front of her, initially with a look of shock but then with determination.",2,4,41
Korra,You again.,2,4,41
,"The hallucination looks up and stares at Korra for a few more seconds. Without warning, she whips the chain around her wrist in Korra's direction. Korra firebends in defense, but the chain sneaks past her and wraps itself around her leg, pulling it out from under her. Korra is thrown on her back but manages to raise her left to protect her face against the incoming chain, which wraps itself around her arm instead. Cut to Korra's point of view as the apparition slowly advances on her.",2,4,41
Korra,[Close-up; pulling her free arm back and firebending at her attacker.] Leave me alone!,2,4,41
,"As the fireblast dissipates, the shot changes to an aerial view of the alley which reveals that the apparition has disappeared. Meanwhile, four townsfolk have gathered at the entrance to the alleyway, watching Korra seemingly battle nothing.",2,4,41
Man #2,What's wrong with her?,2,4,41
Woman,"[Frontal shot of Korra; she turn toward the woman addressing her, beads of sweat running down the side of her head.] Young lady, are you all right? [Side shot of the crowd as Korra gets on her feet.] Can I take you to a doctor?",2,4,41
Korra,"[Pulling her bag over her shoulder as she walks away from the group, avoiding eye contact.] No, I-I don't need any help.",2,4,41
,"The group watches her leave with skeptical eyes before the scene cuts to a close-up of a dejected Korra's face while she is walking down the street with the full moon lighting up the sky behind her. The shot zooms into her forehead with a brief white flash, as the scene enters a flashback. The camera zooms in on a large cargo ship that is docked at Air Temple Island, the sky gray and covered with clouds. The scene changes to the gangway beside the ship where a group of people are gathered; Asami, Mako and Bolin, with Pabu on his shoulders, walk up to Tenzin, Jinora, and Korra, the latter sitting in her wheelchair as she listens. Meanwhile, the camera pans slowly from left to right.",2,4,41
Bolin,"[Talking to Korra when Asami walks over to Korra's side.] Now don't take this the wrong way, but, I can't wait for you to leave!",2,4,41
Mako,[Crosses his arms before his chest; looks annoyed at Bolin.] How else is she supposed to take that but the wrong way?,2,4,41
Bolin,"[to Mako.] I mean, because I've never had a pen pal before! [Turns to Korra; cut to a frontal view of him with Kya and Senna in the background.] I'm gonna write so many letters and, just to get the ball rolling, here. [He takes a letter from his pocket and hands it to Korra.] Spoiler alert: Pabu and I already miss you.",2,4,41
,"Korra takes the letter, as Pabu chirps happily. Cut to a frontal view of Korra, Asami and Tenzin with Republic City looming in the background.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Looking down, smiling.] Thanks. That's sweet.",2,4,41
Asami,"[Leaning over and putting her hands on Korra's shoulders, as she looks up at her.] Are you sure you don't want some company in the Southern Water Tribe? I'm happy to come with you.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Turning away from Asami, the smile gone from her face, facing no one in particular as she stares ahead.] No ... I appreciate it, but I'll only be gone a couple of weeks. [Pulling her hands away from Korra's shoulders, Asami leans back.] A little time alone will be good for me.",2,4,41
,Cut to a frontal view of Tenzin and Jinora.,2,4,41
Tenzin,"[Lays a hand on Korra's right shoulder as he speaks.] Now, I don't want you to worry about a thing while you're gone. Your recovery should be your number one concern. [Shift to a close-up of Korra's downcast face as the camera slowly pans from left to right.] Jinora, the airbenders, and I have everything under control.",2,4,41
,"Shot fades from Korra's downcast face to the ship departing, the group on the dock waving goodbye to those on the deck of the ship.",2,4,41
Asami,"Bye, Korra!",2,4,41
Mako,Get better soon!,2,4,41
Bolin,Don't forget to write!,2,4,41
,"Korra sits in her chair with Kya, Tonraq and Senna being next to her who are smiling thinly. Her parents stand on her right side and Kya on her left side. She initially waves back, smiling, but the smile and her hand both drop quickly, and she looks away. Cut to the Southern Water Tribe some time later, the green aurora blazing in the night sky, as the camera zooms in on the palace. Another cut to Korra, tossing and turning in her bed in a fitful sleep. As she moans and groans, the scene cuts to her face and zooms in on it, followed by a pair flashbacks: Zaheer floating over her limp body while is asphyxiating her and the air being pulled from her lungs. A quick cut back to Korra, whose eyes widen in terror as she wakes up. Cut to a side-shot of her bolting upright in bed and breathing heavily, as Naga, on the floor next to her bed, pokes her head up with the camera panning from left to right. The scene changes. Cut to Korra in her wheelchair sitting on a porch, silently watching the southern lights dancing across the sky. Senna walks up behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.",2,4,41
Senna,"[Softly.] Can't sleep again? [Cut to a frontal view of the two. Korra simply drops her head to her chest in response. Senna kneels beside her daughter, caressing her hair.] Honey, your father and I have tried to give you as much space as you've needed, but we're worried. [Korra blinks, silently listening to her mother's words.] You're not sleeping, you're barely eating. We don't want to push you, but it's been three weeks. [Cut to a side-shot of Korra.] Will you please go see Katara?",2,4,41
Korra,"[Hesitating for a moment, her eyes closed while the camera zooms in on her face.] All right ... I'll go.",2,4,41
,The shot changes back to the frontal view of them.,2,4,41
Senna,"You're going to get through this. [Sighs as Korra glances at her.] I love you so much. [She leans over and hugs her daughter's head, Korra taking hold of her arm.]",2,4,41
,"Close-up of Korra's face; Unseen by Senna, Korra closes her eyes, and a tear rolls down her face. The scene switches to Korra in Katara's hut, undergoing a healing session, the glowing water moving rhythmically back and forth. Smooth panning from right to left.",2,4,41
Katara,The poison did a lot of internal damage.,2,4,41
,Close-up of Korra,2,4,41
Korra,[Glancing over at Katara.] Can you fix it?,2,4,41
,Cut to Katara overlooking her body during the healing,2,4,41
Katara,"I can help guide your healing process, [Stops healing, glow fades as she looks down.] but whether you get better or not, [She looks up to Korra.] is up to you.",2,4,41
,"Brief cut to a close-up of Korra sitting up in the water, not looking at Katara. The shot changes, showing them both sideways. Panning from left to right.",2,4,41
Katara,"I know what it's like to go through a traumatic experience. [Glancing at Korra.] And I promise you, if you dedicate yourself to getting better, you'll recover, [She looks down again.] stronger than ever.",2,4,41
Korra,[Eyes narrowing in desperation.] That's what I want. [Looks up at Katara.] More than anything!,2,4,41
Katara,"Then try something for me. Concentrate [She looks at Korra's toe in the water.] on your big toe. [Korra looks down at it as the view cuts to her submerged feet while zooming in on them.] Visualize it moving. [Cut to Korra's face, determined.] Breathe.",2,4,41
,"Closing her eyes, Korra takes a deep breath, slowly exhaling and focusing. Cut back to her feet. After a few seconds, the big toe of her right foot twitches slightly and moves more noticeably. Korra's depression instantly changes to exhilaration.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Close-up of her excited face.] Did you see that? [Zoom-in on Katara, still smiling softly.] It worked!",2,4,41
,"The scene fades once again, this time to a farther shot of Korra using a set of parallel bars with Katara standing next to her, the wheelchair sitting on the far side of the room next to a sleeping Naga. Smooth panning from right to left.",2,4,41
Katara,"The mind can be a powerful ally, [Close-up of her serious face.] or your greatest enemy. [Smiling.] Now, I want you to try [Close-up of Korra's strained face, pearls of sweat trickle down her face while she is struggling to stand.] taking a step.",2,4,41
,"Korra looks down at her unresponsive feet, panting, as the camera slowly pans from right to left. As she tries to move her left leg, the shot switches to her expression suddenly changing to terror as another vision overtakes her: the camera quickly zooms in on her forehead, followed by a white flash, revealing a chained up Korra screaming in pain as the metallic poison is being administrated into her body in the Red Lotus's hideout. Quick zoom-out, another flash, back to the present. Korra's eyes widen in terror and she loses her grip on the bars, causing her to fall over onto her face as she covers her head in shame.",2,4,41
Katara,"You're okay. [Kneeling and speaking softly.] Your body thinks it is still in danger, but you're safe here. [Naga walks up behind the two with a worried look as she looks at Korra.] Use your mind to overcome the pain. Try again.",2,4,41
Korra,[Looks up briefly before covering her face with her hands; defeated.] I'm done for today.,2,4,41
,"The scene jumps ahead in time a short way, showing Korra in her room while propped up in bed, reading letters from her friends, with Naga curled up on the floor next to the wheelchair. While she's reading the letters, their voices are to be heard off-screen.",2,4,41
Asami,"[Voice-over.] Dear Korra. I miss you. It's not the same in Republic City without you. How are you feeling? [Close-up of Korra.] Things are going well here. I just got a big contract to help redesign the city's infrastructure, so I'll be keeping pretty busy for a while.",2,4,41
,The shot fades to a side view of Korra's bed from a different angle.,2,4,41
Mako,"[Voice-over.] Hey, Korra! Sooo, I'm not very good at writing letters. It's 2:15 in the afternoon. Weather is fair. Chance of snow showers later today. But enough joking around. [Cut to Korra; pan from bottom to top.] I hope you're dong well. Me? I'm back on the beat. Beifong has me staking out the Red Monsoon hideout. You won't believe what's going down.",2,4,41
,The view fades again. This time to a closer side view of the bed while the camera pans diagonally from the nightstand with a pile of letters to the ceiling.,2,4,41
Bolin,"[Voice-over; formal.] My dearest Avatar Korra. Though several fortnights have passed since your departure to convalesce in the homeland of your tribesmen, I feel our friendship knows neither time ... nor distance.",2,4,41
,"Here, Korra sets down, on top of a crudely drawn picture of himself and Korra together, a second rough drawing of Pabu, Zhu Li, Varrick, and Kuvira . A third drawing rests in the background, depicting clouds, wind, stars, and a flower. Bolin's letter continues.",2,4,41
Bolin,"[Voice-over.] You will be most pleased to learn that I found gainful employment with Sir Varrick and the Lady Kuvira. I set off on the morrow with some trepidation, [Close-up of Korra's sad face.] but I am eager to offer any aid I can in stabilizing the Earth Kingdom!",2,4,41
,"Saddened, she lets the letter fall softly to the floor, where it comes to rest with several more just like it. A far shot of the palace shows the light of her room switching off, leaving the entire palace in darkness. The scene changes; it is later on, back in Katara's healing hut. Korra dejectedly stares down the parallel bars while Katara sips tea to her right, Naga plopped down at the end of the bars.",2,4,41
Katara,[Lowering her cup.] Whenever you're ready.,2,4,41
Korra,[Sighing.] What's the point? We've been at this for almost six months and I can still barely take a couple of steps without collapsing!,2,4,41
Katara,"I know you're frustrated, but—",2,4,41
Korra,"Of course I'm frustrated! A crazy man poisoned me and now I can't dress myself, or cook for myself, o-or do anything for myself! And this whole time, my friends have been off helping the world while I'm stuck with you and you can't even heal me!",2,4,41
,"Katara says nothing; she only looks at Korra with a startled expression. Korra's flash of anger breaks, and she realizes what she has said, quickly turning away from Katara's as she buries her face in her hand.",2,4,41
Korra,[Apologetically.] That came out wrong.,2,4,41
Katara,"It's ... all right. [Setting down her teacup and standing, walking over to Korra.] Let your anger and frustration flow like water.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Not looking up as Katara stands in front of her.] I am trying to understand why this happened to me, [Raises her hand from her face.] but nothing makes any sense! [Weary.] I'm tired, Katara. I'm so tired.",2,4,41
Katara,"[Smiling, she kneels down to Korra while Naga watches from the back.] Korra, I know you feel alone right now. But you're not the first Avatar who's had to overcome great suffering. [Her expression shifts to one of sympathy.] Can you imagine how much pain Aang felt when he learned that his entire culture was taken from him?",2,4,41
Korra,[Her eyes falling to her lap; empathetic.] That ... must have been so awful.,2,4,41
Katara,[Voice-over.] But he never let it destroy his spirit. [Korra looks up at Katara.] He chose to find meaning in his suffering and eventually ... found peace.,2,4,41
Korra,And ... what am I going to find if I ... get through this?,2,4,41
Katara,I don't know. [Smiling.] But won't it be interesting to find out?,2,4,41
,"The next shot shows Korra's hands grasping the bars for support, Katara standing next to her and Naga sitting up at the bars' end.",2,4,41
Katara,Close your eyes. Visualize yourself walking over to Naga. [Naga's head perks up.] Can you see it?,2,4,41
Korra,"[Struggling to stay upright, her eyes closed.] Yes.",2,4,41
Katara,Now ... [Smiling.] take that first step.,2,4,41
,"Korra braces herself against the pain and slowly inches her right foot forward, placing it on the ground in front of her. She takes another step, followed by another, and yet another. As she takes her sixth step, she inadvertently takes her hand off one of the bars, and she stumbles. Fighting to stay on her feet, she forces herself back upright. Katara watches her with a smile. Taking the final few steps, Korra stumbles over to Naga, and embraces her with a smile on her face, letting out a relieved sigh. A flash appears again, moving back to the present. To be seen is Korra's scowling face while she is still walking alone down a deserted street from earlier. The shot cuts to a lefthand view of her. A shadow passes behind her, making her stop in her tracks and turn around, seeing nothing. Her gaze lingers a little longer, the shot changing to her point of view and showing fogged street until moving toward her face. When she turns her head back forward, she is initially startled but soon relieved to find a small, white puppy in front of her which is looking up at her and barking a few times and playfully wagging its tail. She walks up to the dog, crouching before it and petting it.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Smiling.] Where'd you come from, little cutie?",2,4,41
,"Looking up for a moment, her expression changes to unease; the view twists again to the back of Korra's head, zooming out of it and revealing the earlier apparition that's standing at the top of the short set of stairs on the road ahead, the colors growing darker. Surprisingly, the puppy whirls around and begins growling menacingly at the apparition. Korra's eyes not leaving the apparition.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Astonished; whispering to the puppy.] You can see her, too?",2,4,41
,"The view changes to a close-up of the apparition who continues to stare at the figures in front of it, wordless and motionless. The screen briefly turns black. Soon after, it fades to an aerial view of the same scene, showing the three. The puppy continues to growl threateningly.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Still looking at the apparition.] If you can see her too, [Standing up; determined.] maybe I'm not going crazy.",2,4,41
,"Cut to the puppy who starts barking, upon which the hallucination absorbs seamlessly into the mist beyond. The puppy relaxes, excitedly making its way toward the now-unoccupied steps, Korra's eyes following it.",2,4,41
Korra,[Amazed.] How'd you do that?,2,4,41
,"The puppy mounts the steps and turns back toward Korra, barking a few times.",2,4,41
Korra,[Questioningly.] You want me to follow you?,2,4,41
,"The puppy barks a few more times and disappears into the mist. Korra pauses for a moment, deciding.",2,4,41
Korra,All right. Let's see what I find.,2,4,41
,"Cut to a far shot of the village showing Korra and the puppy running through the streets, the camera slowly panning upwards before another flashback begins, opening in midair over the compound at the South Pole as Oogi flies by, descending toward it. Oogi lands in the yard, and Tenzin dismounts to find an excited, healthier-looking Korra running toward him. She gives him a hug.",2,4,41
Korra,It's so good to see you!,2,4,41
Tenzin,"[Tentative.] How have you been, Korra? You look great!",2,4,41
Korra,"I feel great! [Grabbing his hands.] Come on, I want to show you how much better I'm doing.",2,4,41
,"Korra excitedly takes Tenzin by his wrists and drags him away with Katara smiling at them in the background. Cut to a shot of the firebending trial mat, where Korra, dressed in battle gear, stands opposite three other firebenders; Tenzin and Katara stand on a viewing platform behind the dueling mat, observing. As the firebenders take their positions, Korra attacks, sending multiple blasts of fire toward her opponents with both her hands and feet, which they easily block.",2,4,41
Korra,[As the flames die.] Attack! I can take it!,2,4,41
,"The firebenders pause momentarily, the bender in the center glancing over his shoulder at the man on his right, who shrugs. They promptly attack, their quick, furious blows smooth and easy as she approaches her opponents. Cutting through a blast of attacking fire with her hands in the same manner as she did in her firebending trial, she emerges on the other side and is immediately beset by another vision: Zaheer zooming down from the gray sky directly toward her. Debilitated, she falters as the firebenders, unaware, continue their attack; she blindly throws weak strands of fire toward nothing in particular before being finally blown off her feet, coming to rest face-down on the mat, exhausted. Tenzin, seeing her collapse, rushes out to stop the fight.",2,4,41
Tenzin,[Signaling with his hand.] All right! The sparring match is over!,2,4,41
,"As the firebenders relax themselves and walk away, Tenzin turns back to focus on Korra, who is getting to her knees and taking off her helmet, clearly upset. Tenzin helps her to her feet.",2,4,41
Korra,[Angrily.] I thought I was ready.,2,4,41
Tenzin,[Looking sympathetically at her.] There is no shame in taking the time you need to make a full recovery. [Closing his eyes.] Being the Avatar can wait.,2,4,41
Korra,[Looking at Tenzin; concerned.] But what about the Earth Kingdom? I hear it's still a mess out there.,2,4,41
Tenzin,The situation has been stabilizing since Kuvira took charge.,2,4,41
Korra,"But that should be me out there fixing things, not her.",2,4,41
Tenzin,"I know you want to help. But trust me, everyone has this under control. I just think you need to ...",2,4,41
,He trails off as Korra looks at him spitefully.,2,4,41
Korra,"[Angrily.] If you say, ""be patient"", I swear I'm gonna water-smack you in the mouth!",2,4,41
Tenzin,"[Avoiding her gaze.] Nooo ... I was going to say, you need to ... not worry about the future. Be grateful for where you are now and the progress you've made.",2,4,41
,"Unsatisfied, she throws her helmet and, turning her back on a sad looking Tenzin, walks away. The scene changes to Korra on a high cliff, practicing bending all the elements as her voice dictates the words of a letter.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Voice-over.] Dear Asami, I'm sorry I haven't written to you sooner, but every time I've tried, I never know what to say. [Cut to Katara and a healing session.] The past two years have been the hardest of my life. Even though I can get around fine now, I still can't go into the Avatar State. I keep having visions of Zaheer and what happened that day. [Cut to a shot of Korra meditating on the roof of the Water Tribe Avatar Temple.] Katara thinks a lot of this is in my head, so I've been meditating a lot, but sometimes I worry I'll never fully recover. [Cut to Korra writing the letter in her room.] Please don't tell Mako and Bolin I wrote to you and not them. I don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's easier to tell you about this stuff. [Setting her pen aside.] I don't think they'd understand.",2,4,41
,"Finishing, Korra sets the pen down and stares off into space, thinking. The scene changes to the dining room; Tonraq, Senna and Korra sit together, but while Tonraq and Senna are eating, Korra plays with her food instead, lost in thought. Both Tonraq and Senna pick up on their daughter's mood, the latter speaking up.",2,4,41
Senna,"Everything all right, sweetie?",2,4,41
Korra,[Keeping her gaze on her plate for a moment before looking up at them.] There's something I need to tell you both.,2,4,41
Tonraq,What is it?,2,4,41
Korra,I want to go back to Republic City.,2,4,41
Senna,Are you sure?,2,4,41
Korra,"I know I'm not a hundred percent yet, but I feel like I've hit a wall. I need to be where the action is, [Smiling.] where my friends are.",2,4,41
Tonraq,[Exchanging a worried look with Senna before responding; smiling.] I'll have the White Lotus prepare a boat and they can take you back to Republic City as soon as you're ready.,2,4,41
,"Cut mid-speech to a view of blue sails opening in a breeze, and Korra standing on the deck of the small craft, waving goodbye.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Voice-over.] No, I want to go alone and have some time to clear my head. It'll be good for me.",2,4,41
,"View cuts to her parents waving back from the dock, Naga standing next to them. She howls as Korra departs. The scene transitions to the open sea, where Korra's boat sails swiftly in the wind as Korra looks off into the distance. Out of nowhere, a school of flying dolphin-fish surface, gliding over the face of the water as Korra looks on, smiling. Another scene transition, this time to a tiny port village in a tropical archipelago, where Korra's boat is docked. Korra herself walks along the dock, away from her boat toward a man in a dockside shack, who is lazily fanning himself in the heat. Korra approaches him, and he looks up.",2,4,41
Korra,"Two lobster crabs, please.",2,4,41
Fishmonger,"[Sudden realization.] Why, you're the Avatar, ain'tcha?",2,4,41
Korra,"[Flatly.] Yup, that's me.",2,4,41
,"The fishmonger jumps out of his chair suddenly, surprising Korra.",2,4,41
Fishmonger,"[Thrilled.] I can't believe it! Mind if I took a picture for my ""Wall of Avatars""?",2,4,41
,"The camera zooms in on the sole picture in his collection, an image of an adult Aang doing his marble trick with two pieces of seafood, his face bearing a look of unadulterated enthusiasm reminiscent of his childhood.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Taken aback.] Well, uhm, I'm kind of in a hurry.",2,4,41
Fishmonger,"[Perched on his table.] I-it'll only take a second! [He retreats to dig out his camera, throwing odds and ends out behind him toward Korra.] Avatar Aang was a big fan of my seaweed wraps, you know, so, [a pot, a meat cleaver, and a flock of parrots come flying out of the shack in quick succession, as Korra jumps backward.] I named 'em ""Aang Rolls""! [Setting the camera down in front of Korra.] Now they're my biggest seller! And they ain't even got fish in 'em! [Laughs as he puts his head into the camera.] Now, smile!",2,4,41
,"The view shifts to the interior of the camera, where an inverted image of an awkwardly smiling Korra is seen. The flash goes off, and the view returns to normal, Korra momentarily blinded by the light.",2,4,41
Fishmonger,"But if I coulda met any Avatar, [Dreamy.] I'd have to pick Kyoshi. Taking down a shark squid with one hand! Now that's a lady I'd like to get to know!",2,4,41
,A sudden cry from behind Korra cuts the fishmonger short. They both look to see what's happened.,2,4,41
Vendor,[Yelling after two people running away.] Thieves! Get back here!,2,4,41
Fishmonger,"[Yelling to the vendor.] Oh, don't worry, the Avatar's right here! [Korra's eyes widen at her mention; to Korra, excitedly.] Well, what are you waiting for? [Gestures toward the thieves.] Go get 'em!",2,4,41
,"Looking determined, Korra throws herself into the air over the small inlet, waterbending herself across and coming ashore just in front of the bandits, who stop in their tracks.",2,4,41
Korra,Hand over the bags or else.,2,4,41
,"The first thief earthbends a fissure into the ground, extending it toward Korra and sending up a great cloud of dust, while the second thief bends a few simple boulders from the ground and hurls them at her. Korra avoids the fissures but rolls face-first right into the flying rocks; she falls to the ground, holding her head which is pounding from the impact, as the thieves run past her to freedom. Opening her eyes, she sees the vendor from across the way standing over her, assessing her, while the fishmonger rushes up to her, meat cleaver in hand, panting.",2,4,41
Vendor,[To the fishmonger; skeptical.] You sure she's the Avatar?,2,4,41
,"They both look down questioningly at Korra, who closes her eyes. The scene fades to a view of Republic City from the bay, the skyline blurred by the nighttime fog. As the shot pans to the left, Korra's craft comes into view, and the shot changes to one of Korra standing on the small deck. As she rounds Air Temple Island, the fog suddenly burns off, revealing a lone figure standing on a pinnacle of rock jutting from the water near the cliffside, eyes glowing. Korra gasps, as the shot cuts to a close-up of the face of Dark Korra with the moon behind, thin eyebrows furrowed and mouth bent into an angry frown, her hair fluttering in the light breeze. Korra, seeing this for the first time, sweat beading on her face, closes her eyes and steers the boat into the opposite direction, not watching as Republic City disappears into the mist. Another change of scene as Korra's boat is seen somewhere in the Earth Kingdom, Korra herself standing on a small dock next to it. Her dress has changed from her Water Tribe outfit to that of an Earth Kingdom commoner, save for her armband, which she removes and tosses into the water. She moves her hands to her head, taking her hair in her hands and bundling it at the back of her head. Holding the bundle with her left hand, she takes up a knife laying on her right and puts it up against her hair. For a moment, she hesitates, reluctant to leave herself behind. In one stroke, she pulls the blade through her hair with a hint of regret on her face, sending tiny strands of hair fluttering through the air around her, her new haircut coming to rest just above her shoulders. The scene changes yet again, jumping to a snowstorm at one of the poles, its Spirit Portal emitting its brilliant beam of light into the sky in the distance. Korra crosses into the frame, bundled up against the bitter cold and wind; she stops for a moment, observing the portal in the distance, before continuing onward toward it. The view switches to just inside the Spirit World as Korra steps through the portal and exits on the other side; the Tree of Time, surrounded by friendly spirits, dominates the landscape around it from its perch. Cut to Korra, who has sat down within the Tree's central void, meditating in silence, her heavy overcoat folded next to her. A tiny tan-yellow spirit, with leaves growing like ears from the top of its head, peers over the lip of the entrance. Realizing who is within, it smiles and calls to its many companions floating outside.",2,4,41
Light spirit,"Everyone, come here! It's the Avatar!",2,4,41
,"The spirits congregate on the lip, observing Korra for themselves. A second spirit, resembling a snail of sorts with legs, turns to the light spirit.",2,4,41
Skeptical spirit,"[Skeptically.] You sure? I don't sense any Raava energy around her. Besides, she's not dressed like the Avatar. And, doesn't the Avatar have ponytails?",2,4,41
Korra,"[Eyes closed; annoyed.] Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate here. And yes, I am the Avatar. I'm just wearing different clothes and I cut my hair.",2,4,41
Light spirit,[Excited.] See? I told you guys it was her! [Jumps into the tree and walks up to Korra as the rest of the group follows.] How come you've been away so long?,2,4,41
Korra,I was hurt pretty bad a while ago and lost touch with my Avatar Spirit.,2,4,41
Skeptical spirit,No wonder I couldn't feel Raava's energy.,2,4,41
Korra,"I came to the Tree of Time hoping to reconnect with Raava and turn on the Avatar State again. But it's not working. [She continues as the light spirit climbs onto her lap.] The last time I was here, I saw all sorts of visions. [Quietly.] Now I don't see anything.",2,4,41
Light spirit,[Smiling up at her.] Maybe we can help you get better.,2,4,41
Korra,"[Lifts the spirit off her lap and stands up.] I'm sorry, but for years, people have been saying they can help me get better. [Starts walking away.] Nothing's worked. [Stops at the exit of the Tree of Time's hollow and looks back over her shoulder.] I need to figure this out on my own.",2,4,41
,"She leaves the tree, not looking back, as the spirits look after her. The scene changes to Korra's boat wending through a waste of water and icebergs as her voice, in the background, narrates a letter.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Voice-over.] Dear Mom and Dad, [standing on the deck, she turns to her left and sees the hallucination of her glaring back at her from a nearby iceberg. She ignores it.] I arrived in Republic City a couple weeks ago and couldn't be happier. It's nice to be back at the temple and it's great to see my friends again. [Cut to Korra walking through a lavafield, where, again, the hallucination appears and she ignores it again.] Don't worry, I'm taking it easy, but hopefully I'll be back in action soon. I miss you both very much. Please, give Naga a big hug for me. Love, Korra. [Cut to Korra in the middle of a desert, her arm raised to shield against the sun; she suddenly spots Raava waiting at the crest of a dune.] Raava? [She scales the dune, climbing toward the spirit.] Raava!",2,4,41
,"She reaches the crest of the dune, only to find empty air where Raava was; she falls to her knees, realizing it was another hallucination. Fade to just before the present, where Korra is walking through a town somewhere in the Earth Kingdom. Lifting her head, she sees her hallucination waiting at the end of her path, illuminated by a streetlight. The view again rolls as it zooms on the apparition, and as it does, it turns, walking away down a side alley.",2,4,41
Korra,[Angry and tired of being haunted.] I am ending this.,2,4,41
,"She chases her likeness down the alley, where she sees it jump a fence and follows it, landing on a rooftop on the other side. Looking for where the ghost has gone, she spots it standing in the entrance of a building, the light from its interior pouring into the street; people are standing near the entrance, and Korra's apparition stands there as well. A single person passes the entrance, and as he passes the place where the apparition stands, it vanishes into thin air. Korra, seeing what she has to do, jumps from the roof, determination etched in her face. Inside the building sits the arena, with two earthbenders sparring in the pit beneath as the crowd cheers; as she passes across the view of the ring, her ghost appears, standing in the pit itself, unseen by everybody except herself. She walks up to the ring announcer, who half-turns to look at her while collecting money from people placing bets in the audience.",2,4,41
Korra,Excuse me. Who do I talk to about getting in the ring?,2,4,41
,"The ring announcer raises an eyebrow at her. Cut to Korra in the ring, being beaten back by her opponent. After being thrown across the ring and crashing into the wall, she gets up, but she suddenly starts to see double, and the crowd above fades into blackness. Where seconds before she had seen an earthbender, she now sees the hallucination of her standing opposite her, shoulders hunched in the same familiar inhuman pose. Rising defiantly to her feet, Korra yells at the apparition.",2,4,41
Korra,Is that all you got?,2,4,41
,"The apparition swings her arms, the chain flying like a whip across the ring as Korra dodges. The apparition moves faster than she can see, and it jumps, formless, through space before solidifying above Korra. Its attack, unseen by Korra until the last moment, catches her in the face. Her head hits the dirt before her feet, and she tumbles across the floor, slamming into the wall behind her. She struggles to rise for a moment, staring the vengeful vision in the face before she falls, unconscious, to the floor, and the vision melts back into reality.",2,4,41
Ring announcer,We have a winner!,2,4,41
,"The other earthbender raises her arms in victory. A quick succession of shots flashes by: Korra healing herself in the bathroom, being yelled at to ""hurry up in there""; nearly being run down; and the angrily barking puppy. The scene switches to Korra chasing the dog on the outskirts of the town. At the top of a hill, she pauses; the shot changes its perspective, showing a swamp in the direction in which the dog is running.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Mildly confused.] Why did you bring me to the swamp? [She slides down a small hill, still following the puppy, and as they pass a tree at the entrance to the swamp, the puppy, in a flash of light, transforms into the light spirit. Korra realizes.] Wait, I met you at the Tree of Time. [Stronger voice.] You should have told me who you were.",2,4,41
Light spirit,"[Simply, turning to face Korra.] If I did, would you have followed me?",2,4,41
Korra,[Relenting.] I get your point. But why did you bring me here? What am I gonna find in the swamp?,2,4,41
Light spirit,"Not a what, a who. [Rising into the air and flying off through the vines.]",2,4,41
Korra,"[Panicking.] No, wait! [She rushes forward, charging through the vines.] Come back!",2,4,41
,"Stumbling through to the other side, she falls into a pool of water. Looking up, she is terrified to find herself face to face with her apparition. Korra rises to her feet.",2,4,41
Korra,[Panicked.] You're just in my mind. You're not real.,2,4,41
,"Korra's projection does nothing for a short moment, before sending a powerful blast of fire at Korra; it hits her, sending her flying through the air, where she collides with a tree and collapses into the water below. Trying to rise again, she looks up to see her dark self stagger-stepping through the vines in front of her. Korra sends streams of water at the vision, but it evaporates on the spot, reforming itself out of the way and sending fire, water, and earth of its own back at Korra. Korra, dodging the water and fire, is hit head-on by the earth and flies backward again, tumbling into a hole. The blurred gray streak of the apparition reforms in midair above Korra, its flaming foot creating an arc of flame as it attempts to crush Korra, who somersaults out of the way as the apparition lands with crushing force. Korra doesn't even have time to get back on her feet before the vision furiously blasts her with water, sending her airborne yet again; Korra lands face-first in the mud but gets back to her feet, running as fast as she can away from her hallucination, which, deforming and reforming rapidly, appears behind her, shooting a jet of flame after her. Korra ducks as it shoots over her head and, jumping and twisting in midair, earthbends back at her doppelganger before immediately jumping with airbending into the tree sprawling above her. As the Korra's Avatar self reforms under the tree, glaring up at the escaping Korra, it unwinds the chain from its wrist, once more wielding it as a whip, cracking it on the ground with enough force to shake the earth before flinging it up into the tree, where it wraps itself around a fleeing Korra's ankle as she reaches a higher branch. The force of the chain begins to pull her down, and she desperately grabs onto the vines winding around the branches to keep herself from falling. As she looks down at the ground far below, the ground below the feet of Korra's Avatar self, to her horror, melts, turning into the mercury with which Zaheer poisoned her. Korra tries to get her foot around a vine, still holding on for dear life, to try to save herself, but Korra's Avatar self begins to sink into the mercury, pulling still harder against Korra. As the doppelganger sinks up to its still-furious face in the pool of mercury, the vine in Korra's left hand snaps under the weight, and, seconds later, the one in her right hand lets go. Screaming, Korra falls headlong into the puddle of poison below her. As soon as she hits the surface, the mercury fastens onto her body like glue and she begins to sink into the puddle. As web-like tendrils leap from the surface, she reaches into the air, grasping for something that is not there.",2,4,41
Korra,Help!,2,4,41
,"Immediately after she screams, the silver poison wraps around her arm, pulling her down into darkness. Sometime later, Korra awakens in a dimly lit room. A blue-ish light filters through a substance covering the top of a deep hole opening just above her, which extends all the way to ground level, a considerable distance above her. She sits up, her hand on her head, and hears the noise of a moving liquid, followed by an elderly female voice.",2,4,41
Unknown woman,"[Standing over her cooking pot, her back to Korra, who cannot see who she is.] Feeling better?",2,4,41
Korra,Where am I? Wha-what happened?,2,4,41
Unknown woman,I was hoping you could tell me. I found you passed out in the mud.,2,4,41
Korra,How'd you know I was out there?,2,4,41
Unknown woman,"[Casually.] I'm pretty tapped into the goings-on around here. What brings you to the swamp, anyway?",2,4,41
Korra,A spirit led me here and told me I was supposed to find someone. Is that you?,2,4,41
Unknown woman,"Beats me. But if your Avatar senses called you here, you should probably listen to them.",2,4,41
Korra,"[Catching the word ""Avatar"".] Wait, you recognize me?",2,4,41
,She stands up and walks toward the mystery person.,2,4,41
Unknown woman,[Voice-over.] In a manner of speaking. We were good friends in your previous life.,2,4,41
,"Korra firebends a small flame with her hand, casting light on the mysterious person, who turns to face Korra, revealing an elderly woman with long silver hair hanging down over clouded eyes.",2,4,41
Korra,[Astonished; whispering.] I can't believe it ... Toph?,2,4,41
Toph,"[Chuckling.] Nice to see you again, Twinkle Toes.",2,4,41
,Cut to credits.,2,4,41
,"As the title card fades, the scene opens on City Hall; a few spirits play on the spirit vines lining the square.",3,4,42
Wu,"[Waving his arms as he acts out his vision for Mako, who is standing in front of him.] So then the crowds are gathered, all excited to see my coronation, when all of a sudden, these boulders come rolling through. And guess what pops out of 'em? Earthbender dames! These gals start banging the boulders like drums, and sing the song of my royal lineage. [Puts fingers together.] It's the most dynamite six-hour show you'll ever see in your life. [Puts hands on his hips.]",3,4,42
Mako,"Shouldn't you be getting ready to, [Shrugs shoulders.] I don't know ... rule a whole nation?",3,4,42
Wu,"[Waving his hand.] Now, now, now, don't get yourself in a tizzy. [Puts index finger on Mako's chest.] I'll have ministers for all that! [Putting an arm around Mako.] No, sir, Mako, when we get to Ba Sing Se, it'll just be two kooky pals, living the life! [Pats Mako on the chest.]",3,4,42
Mako,[Sarcastically.] Yay ...,3,4,42
,President Raiko enters the scene.,3,4,42
Raiko,Getting excited for your big day?,3,4,42
Wu,"Does a platypus-bear poop in‒ Hey! [Turns around angrily as he sees metalbenders putting up spectator stands. He races over to berate them.] You can't put bleachers there! There won't be enough room for the Dance of the Badgermoles! Look, it's going to go like this. [Proceeds to dance as Mako and Raiko look on.]",3,4,42
Mako,You sure that's the guy you want running the Earth Kingdom?,3,4,42
,"Tenzin enters the scene. Him too, looking at Wu's dance.",3,4,42
Raiko,Trust me. We'll be sending a delegation of experienced advisers to handle day-to-day governing.,3,4,42
Tenzin,"[Cut to Tenzin, Mako, and Raiko.] I see the prince is becoming accustomed to the burdens of leadership.",3,4,42
Raiko,You know royals. They love a ceremony. Have you received any word on the Avatar's location?,3,4,42
Tenzin,"[Close-up as he turns to face them.] Not yet, but I have airbenders all over the world on the lookout for her. [Worried.] I hope they find her soon. I'm concerned about reports I've heard regarding Kuvira's growing military. They say she's throwing some of her dissenters into prison camps.",3,4,42
,"Cut to Raiko and Mako, while Tenzin has his back to the camera.",3,4,42
Raiko,"Well, she'll be stepping down tomorrow. We can worry about correcting any of her mistakes after that.",3,4,42
Mako,And you're not worried about her handing power over to Prince Wu?,3,4,42
Raiko,"[Close-up.] When Kuvira started cleaning up the Earth Kingdom, she knew her position wasn't permanent. She gave me her word that she'd step down.",3,4,42
Tenzin,"[Cut to Wu, who is still doing his dance.] Still, I'd feel a lot better if Korra were here.",3,4,42
,"Next cut shows the swamp, where Korra and Toph are shown in Toph's dwelling. Korra stands on the left, while Toph sits on the right, drinking tea.",3,4,42
Korra,You got to help me get back into Avatar fighting shape. [Close-up.] I'm getting my butt kicked by losers all over the Earth Kingdom. The world needs me.,3,4,42
Toph,[Cut to Toph.] Get over yourself! The world doesn't need you one bit.,3,4,42
Korra,"[Cut to a view of both women, with Korra behind Toph.] But, while I've been the Avatar, I've stopped some really bad people from doing some really bad things.",3,4,42
Toph,"Listen, when I was Chief of Police in Republic City, I worked my butt off busting criminals. But did that make crime disappear? Nope. If there's one thing I learned on the beat, it's that the names change, but the street stays the same.",3,4,42
Korra,"So, basically, you're saying that everything I've ever accomplished has been pointless. [More to herself.] And I thought Beifong was grumpy.",3,4,42
Toph,[Upbeat.] I'm the original Beifong!,3,4,42
Korra,So ... you're not going to train me?,3,4,42
Toph,"Well, I was planning on soaking my feet in mud for a few weeks. [Sighs.] But I can't stand you being so pathetic and getting your butt kicked all the time. All right, I guess I can help.",3,4,42
Korra,Thank you!,3,4,42
,"Korra moves in to hug Toph, but Toph bends a wall between them, knocking Korra down.",3,4,42
Toph,"Na-uh-uh-uh. You want to hug something, [Pushes wall down again.] go hug a tree. [Close-up, smiling.] We're here to work!",3,4,42
,"Cut to Wu's hotel in Republic City, where Bolin, Kuvira, Baatar Jr. and the rest of Kuvira's delegation arrive.",3,4,42
Bolin,"Hello Republic Cit-ay! Bolin ... is back! [The frame zooms suddenly and dramatically on Eska, who is standing in the lobby with her brother Desna. Bolin sees her staring at him and reels back, seized by a fit of terror. He becomes more downbeat.] And ... Eska is also here.",3,4,42
Eska,"[Slides in front of Bolin.] I see you have replaced me with a new girlfriend. [Kuvira is brought into the shot, talking to a soldier.] Well done, she seems very threatening.",3,4,42
Bolin,"Oh no no, that's Kuvira, she's kind of my boss.",3,4,42
Eska,"[Cut to Eska and Desna.] Boss, girlfriend. Same thing.",3,4,42
Cam,"[Interrupting, addressing Eska.] I'm afraid there's been a mistake, Your Eminence. We have you and your brother booked in the same room, with only one bed.",3,4,42
Eska,It's no mistake. Desna sleeps in the tub.,3,4,42
,"Eska shoots a look over her shoulder and walks off with her brother. Cut to Varrick, who is waiting for Zhu Li, who is carrying four suitcases, to catch up with him.",3,4,42
Varrick,Never thought I'd be allowed back in the Republic City Four Elements. [Zhu Li puts down a lot of suitcases which appear to be very heavy.] Raiko must have turned purple when Kuvira made him pardon me of my alleged crimes.,3,4,42
Zhu Li,"You're an upstanding citizen again, sir.",3,4,42
Varrick,"[Excited again, he moves his arms up and down as the cut focuses on him.] Upstanding is right! [Quiets down to a whisper, moving his eyebrows up and down.] And don't forget to fill the extra bag with as many of those little soaps as you can grab. [Fixes collar.] Love the lavender scent.",3,4,42
,"Mako and Wu walk in with two guards who are at the door. Mako immediately spots Bolin, who is standing in the center albeit with his back turned.",3,4,42
Mako,"Bolin! [Bolin turns around, and they trade some mock-punches before hugging each other.] Look at you! My little brother got all ... important.",3,4,42
Bolin,"I know, right? I see myself in the mirror sometimes and I think I'm in trouble before I realize: it's only me.",3,4,42
Mako,"[Quick cut to Mako.] So, what's it like working for Kuvira? [Cut to Kuvira, who is talking to Baatar Jr..] From what I've heard, she's pretty harsh.",3,4,42
Bolin,"[Cut back to Bolin and Mako.] No! I—I mean, she can be tough, sure, but we're turning around the Earth Kingdom like you wouldn't believe! You remember how bad Grandma's neighborhood in Ba Sing Se was? All that's completely changed, I mean, we are really ... helping people. But what have you been up to? Fighting crime? [Mimics fighting.] Busting triads? Chasing the ladies, [Shouldering Mako playfully in the chest.] Mako-style?",3,4,42
Mako,"[Downbeat.] Well, I've been working for Wu. [Looks over to Wu, who is fixing his hair in the reflection of a window.] And, uhhh ... [Lets his head hang in disappointment.] Yeah.",3,4,42
Bolin,"So, have you seen Korra yet?",3,4,42
Mako,"No. She was supposed to come in with Tonraq, but he said she left the South Pole months ago. No one knows where she is.",3,4,42
,"Bolin gets a worried look on his face. Cut to Suyin, who is handed the keys to her room, when she is approached by Baatar Jr.",3,4,42
Baatar Jr.,Mother.,3,4,42
Suyin,"Hello, Baatar Jr.",3,4,42
Baatar Jr.,"It's just ""Baatar"" now. So, now that you've seen all the good we've done since we left Zaofu, you must be sorry that you didn't come and help us.",3,4,42
Suyin,"I don't know if I'd call marching all over the Earth Kingdom, forcing people to bow to Kuvira, ""doing good"".",3,4,42
Baatar Jr.,You're going to have to get over your grudge with her. I'm sure you've heard that we're engaged. She's going to be an official member of our family.,3,4,42
Suyin,I'm just glad she'll be stepping down after tomorrow.,3,4,42
Baatar Jr.,"You prefer to be ruled by [Looks over his shoulder toward Wu, who is trying to chat up Kuvira; voice-over.] that royal idiot?",3,4,42
Wu,"I hope I'm not out of order saying this: You're pretty easy on the eyes for a military type. [Kuvira ignores him.] I'll put in a good word for you with the hotel staff, maybe get you a little upgrade. I've been living here for years, they love me.",3,4,42
Kuvira,I won't be needing your help. We've reserved the presidential suite.,3,4,42
Wu,"Well, I think someone is pulling your chain, gumdrop! See, I'm in the presidential suite.",3,4,42
Kuvira,[Turns to face Wu again with a smug smile on her face.] Not anymore. I had you moved out.,3,4,42
Wu,"[Surprised.] Wait, what? [Angrily grabs Cam by the collar.] Cam, where's all my stuff?",3,4,42
Cam,[Blankly.] We've moved you into a very nice junior suite on the seventh floor.,3,4,42
Wu,[Seriously disappointed.] Junior suite?,3,4,42
Kuvira,[Smiling triumphantly.] Something you should know about me: I always get what I want.,3,4,42
,"Cut to Mako and Wu at City Hall, with Wu visibly being worried.",3,4,42
Gun,"[Off-screen.] Your royal cabinet is here, your majesty!",3,4,42
Wu,Where have you been? My coronation is in ten minutes! [Gun and two other walk up to Wu.] Where's everyone else? Where are the Seven Sacred Chests of Exquisite Finery? Where are my grandfather's taffeta pantaloons?,3,4,42
Gun,"Sadly, most of your servants were scattered and the royal things were looted after the queen was [He pauses, choosing his words.] removed from office. So your coronation may not have some of the usual items ... like ... the crown.",3,4,42
Wu,There's no crown?! How can you have a coronation without a crown? [Getting distressed.] How will people know when I'm officially the king?,3,4,42
Gun,[Opening a small jewel box which contains an earring; voice-over.] We still have one of the royal jewels we can pin on you.,3,4,42
Wu,[Annoyed.] An earring?,3,4,42
Gun,Think of it more as a royal brooch. [Holds the earring up and it sparkles.],3,4,42
Wu,"Are you telling me that there are no dancing badgermoles? No acrobat bell ringers, no horn blowing announcery guy?",3,4,42
Gun,"It will be a very simple, intimate, elegant ceremony. A wonderful day for your kingdom. Just try on the brooch, Your Grace, you will see it looks beautiful ... [Tries to pin the earring on Wu, but he stops him and walks off.]",3,4,42
Wu,Don't ... touch me.,3,4,42
,"Cut to the swamp, where Korra and Toph are facing off.",3,4,42
Toph,"Okay, bring it!",3,4,42
,"Korra tries to knock her down with airbending, but Toph evades every blast with her hands behind her back, before knocking Korra down with a single blast of mud. Korra lands in a pool of mud, all dirty, when a poll of grass in blown into her face and a frog-squirrel jumps onto her shoulder and croaks, much to Korra's annoyance.",3,4,42
Toph,Tell me what you did wrong.,3,4,42
Korra,"[Picking up the animal and putting it on her knee.] Well, I was thinking that you were ...",3,4,42
Toph,[Interrupts Korra.] Exactly! You were thinking! [Turns around.] Go again.,3,4,42
,"Korra gets up and tries again, but Toph effortlessly evades everything Korra throws at her, and finally knocks her down again by blasting her away with a stream of mud. She lands in a shallow pool, and turns on her back when Toph stands beside her again.",3,4,42
Toph,"Pathetic. Of all the Avatar's I've worked with, you're by far the worst. I know that's only one other Avatar, [Korra stands up and has a massive elbow leech on her elbow. Toph pulls it off with one quick tug.] but still.",3,4,42
Korra,[As the leech pops off.] Gah! Hey! It seems like you're enjoying having someone around to beat up an awful lot.,3,4,42
Toph,"Yeah, the swampbenders out here really can't take a punch.",3,4,42
Korra,So ... what made you want to drop out and disconnect from the rest of the world?,3,4,42
Toph,"I'm more connected to the world than you've ever been! The roots and vines ... they run all over the world. I can see Su and Lin, Zaofu and Republic City. I see everything. [Korra gets a smile on her face, and silently tries to take Toph by surprise, but she's knocked down once again by the old woman.] You're blind compared to me.",3,4,42
,Cut to Wu's coronation in Republic City. Gun pins the earring on Wu.,3,4,42
Gun,"Now rise, Wu of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, King of all the Earth Lands and glorious defender of Ba Sing Se. Long may you reign!",3,4,42
,A few people are applauding in the crowd.,3,4,42
Spectator #1,[Disinterested.] Go Wu! Woohoo ...,3,4,42
Spectator #2,[Just as disinterested.] Woohoo ...,3,4,42
Wu,"[Now addressing the crowd through the microphone.] Thank you, for that incredibly brief, but very moving ceremony. I am touched by the love of my devoted countrymen, who have worked so hard to restore their beloved leader to the throne. One of them deserves special attention. [Turns to Kuvira.] Kuvira, rise! [She walks over to him.] For your service to the realm, I would like to present you with the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest honor, which was somehow not stolen, unlike the royal pinky rings.",3,4,42
Kuvira,"Thank you. And if you don't mind, I would like to say a few words.",3,4,42
Wu,Why not? [Annoyed.] We've got six hours to fill ...,3,4,42
Kuvira,"[Now addressing the crowd through the microphone.] Growing up in Zaofu, with Suyin Beifong, [Shot shows Suyin, sporting a distrustful look.] I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages. [Shot shows Tenzin and Raiko giving each other a worried look.] I'd like to make an announcement to the world: the Earth Kingdom is no more. And from here on out, [Gestures to Wu.] this man has no authority. [Crowd gasps in surprise.]",3,4,42
Wu,"Wait, what? But I just got the royal brooch!",3,4,42
Kuvira,"[Turns to the crowd again.] I have created a new Earth Empire, and I will continue to lead it into the future myself, bringing about a new era of prosperity for my people.",3,4,42
Crowd,"[Cheers and applauds.] We love you, Kuvira! [Shot shows Bolin, with a worried look on his face, as he applauds halfheartedly.] All hail the Great Uniter!",3,4,42
Kuvira,"And let me assure my fellow leaders of one thing: [Grabs the medal Wu hung around her neck and pulls it off, breaking the ribbon before letting it hover over her hand.] Anyone who crosses our borders or stands in our way, will be crushed. [Crushes the medal and drops it on the floor.]",3,4,42
Crowd,"[Cheering again, the flashbulbs of cameras in the crowd casting erratic shadows on the stage.] Thank you, Kuvira! All hail the Great Uniter!",3,4,42
Wu,[Sighs.] Worst coronation ever.,3,4,42
,"Cut to the Republic City Four Elements hotel again, where Bolin and Varrick sit in the Presidential Suite.",3,4,42
Bolin,Were you surprised? Because I was really surprised. Won't this turn all the world leaders against us?,3,4,42
Varrick,"[Calmly, holding a drink in one hand.] Relax, kid, what can they do? Kuvira controls the whole nation now, and Republic City is begging for the metal that we're mining. This train has left the station, and we own the track!",3,4,42
,"Zhu Li walks in, followed by a spirit vine on a cart.",3,4,42
Varrick,Now that's a nice looking hunk of spirit vine! Let's take it back to the lab and get it stabilized immediately.,3,4,42
,"Zhu Li gestures the men pushing the cart to take it away again, and Varrick goes with them. At the same time, Kuvira enters the room, and looks at Bolin, who sits uneasily in his chair, hands folded and head down.",3,4,42
Kuvira,"You look worried, Bolin.",3,4,42
Bolin,"[Stands up out of his chair.] Yeah, well, I just have some misgivings about how you kind of ambushed Tenzin and the other leaders.",3,4,42
Kuvira,"You believe in the work that we've done for the people of the Earth Empire, right, Bolin?",3,4,42
Bolin,"I do, but ...",3,4,42
Kuvira,[Interrupts him.] Then stick with me. I'm going to need your help now more than ever. Raiko and the other leaders want to bully us into accepting some idiot king who will serve them but neglect the people. We have to stand strong against them.,3,4,42
Bolin,"I'm just not sure about this whole ""Empire"" thing. It seems pretty aggressive. And what was that part about the crushing?",3,4,42
Kuvira,"That was just some ... tough rhetoric to let people know that we mean business. Believe me, [Puts a hand on his shoulder.] conflict is the last thing I want. Will you help me make history, Bolin?",3,4,42
Bolin,[Doubts for a moment.] I'll stand by you.,3,4,42
Kuvira,Thank you.,3,4,42
,"Suyin walks into the room, drawing the attention of both of them.",3,4,42
Suyin,"We need to talk. [Shot pans to her, with an angry expression on her face.]",3,4,42
Kuvira,"[To Bolin, who is clearly uncomfortable with Suyin's presence.] Can you give us the room, please? [He walks out.]",3,4,42
Suyin,"I met with the world leaders, and I've come as their representative.",3,4,42
Kuvira,"So now you're taking an interest in world affairs. A little late, isn't it? When the queen fell, and everyone was asking you to help keep the Earth Kingdom from falling apart, all you wanted to do was hide in Zaofu, and let others deal with the consequences.",3,4,42
Suyin,"That's hardly fair. I didn't want to seize power for myself, which is what you've done. I'm telling you for the good of everyone, you have to step down.",3,4,42
Kuvira,I stepped up. I provide stability and equality. Tell your world leaders to stay out of Earth Empire business. We won't accept their hand-picked dictator.,3,4,42
Suyin,What makes you so different? You're just another tyrant. And don't pretend the people put you where you are. I know what happens to cities who don't want to hand over control to you.,3,4,42
Kuvira,Then you know what's coming for Zaofu.,3,4,42
,Fade to another room in the hotel.,3,4,42
Wu,"First I lose my suite, then I lose my throne. My royal brooch is a lie! [To Mako.] I know you must be crushed, not getting to come back to Ba Sing Se with me.",3,4,42
Mako,[With veiled sarcasm in his voice.] Don't worry about me. I'll ... find a way to make it.,3,4,42
Wu,"Good ol' Mako, my big tough guy. [Grunts.] Okay. I just have to go on, move forward, take decisive action. [Jumping to his feet.] Let's go shopping!",3,4,42
,"Someone knocks on the door, and Mako, opening it, finds Bolin on the other side.",3,4,42
Wu,"[Peeking over Mako's shoulder, annoyed and alarmed.] Ugh. Get rid of him. He's with her.",3,4,42
Mako,He's my brother. [Walks out to the hallway.],3,4,42
Bolin,"Interesting ceremony, huh?",3,4,42
Mako,"You aren't going to keep working for Kuvira now that she's going against the wishes of the entire world, are you?",3,4,42
Bolin,You don't understand. Kuvira is helping out all the poor people of the Earth Empire. People like our family. This is for the best.,3,4,42
Mako,"I don't know, bro.",3,4,42
Bolin,"Okay, why don't you come with me, and you'll see for yourself? We've done a lot of good, and Varrick is working on some new innovations. We're making history.",3,4,42
Mako,"By ""crushing"" anyone who gets in your way?",3,4,42
Bolin,"[Paraphrasing Kuvira.] That was just some tough rhetoric to let the people know that we mean business. I mean, Kuvira is basically just like Korra. [Mako gets the ""raised eyebrow"" look on his face.] She might seem hard to deal with, but just because she's so passionate and believes in what she's doing.",3,4,42
Mako,It seems like she's just a dictator who's taking the Earth Kingdom by force.,3,4,42
Bolin,"[Aggressive.] Oh, okay, you think your new best friend in there [Points to the door of Wu's suite.] would be a better leader than Kuvira?",3,4,42
Mako,"Well, no, but still ...",3,4,42
Bolin,"Still what? Come on, Mako! I'm making a difference out there, what are you doing, huh? You're just some glorified butler for some snotty rich bozo!",3,4,42
,"Cut to Wu on the inside of the door, eavesdropping on the conversation of the bending brothers. He gets agitated at Bolin's remark. Back outside, Bolin walks off.",3,4,42
Mako,"I'm sorry, I don't want to work for your glorious emperor and her military dictatorship.",3,4,42
Bolin,"[Turns around angrily.] Fine! I'm going to go back to my awesome train, where we bring freedom where ever we go! Enjoy licking the king's boots in your junior suite! [Storms off, leaving a disgruntled Mako in his wake.]",3,4,42
Wu,"[Consolingly, as Mako walks back in.] Sorry, sport, I heard it all.",3,4,42
Mako,I can't believe him!,3,4,42
Wu,I know! Insulting another man's suite? It's beneath low. But I think I know what would cheer you up: a visit to Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall! I'll buy you a smoothie.,3,4,42
Mako,[Downcast.] Yeah. Okay.,3,4,42
,"Cut back to the swamp, where Korra and Toph are walking side by side.",3,4,42
Korra,That was terrible.,3,4,42
Toph,"Hah! Maybe for you. I had a great time! I never realized how much I missed tormenting the Avatar [Starts picking something out from between her toes.] I wish you were putting up more of a fight, but it was still fun.",3,4,42
Korra,You were tossing me around like a ragdoll all day long.,3,4,42
Toph,I know! And I'm an old lady! Imagine me in my prime! [Laughs.] I would have destroyed you!,3,4,42
Korra,"I just don't understand why I can't get back to my former self. It's like ... I'm a step slower. I'm tentative, I'm out of sync, I just can't get back in the groove.",3,4,42
Toph,[Matter-of-factly.] Probably carrying around that metal doesn't help.,3,4,42
Korra,[Suddenly attentive.] What metal?,3,4,42
Toph,The little bits of metal poison stuck in your body. Are you trying to tell me you can't feel metal in your own body? You really are the worst Avatar ever.,3,4,42
Korra,[Shocked.] I thought Su got it all out.,3,4,42
Toph,"Oh, my girls never really picked up metalbending all that well, if you ask me.",3,4,42
Korra,"[Excitedly climbs the tree root Toph is standing on and grabs her by the shoulders.] That's been my problem this entire time! I gotta get it out! You can get it out for me, right?",3,4,42
Toph,Who do you think you're talking to? [Pushes Korra away.],3,4,42
,"Cut to the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, where Mako and Wu sit drinking smoothies through straws.",3,4,42
Wu,"Once we're done with these, we can go into the Middle Ring and I'll let you pick out some new suits, then we'll hit the boutiques in the Upper Ring for me. [Two girls walk by wearing shirts that have the logo of The Metal Clan and Kuvira's face on them. Wu, mentally double-taking, spits his drink onto Mako, scrambling to his feet and dashing after them, angry.] Where did you get those shirts?",3,4,42
Girl #1,"Aces, right? Kuvira is my hero.",3,4,42
Girl #2,They're selling them over there.,3,4,42
,"She points to a store with a large crowd of Kuvira supporters in front of it. Wu pulls his hair in exasperation, squealing, before angrily running toward the shop.",3,4,42
Wu,"[To the gathered people.] You can't sell that junk in here! This is the Little Ba Sing Se Fashion Mall, and I'm the Little King here! Respect the brooch!",3,4,42
Crowd,"[Begins booing him.] Stop it, Little King!",3,4,42
Wu,[Angry.] I am the Glorious Defender!,3,4,42
,Wu throws his smoothie at the group. The sound of the cup hitting something and spilling is heard in the background and the yelling falls momentarily silent.,3,4,42
Crowd,[Off-screen.] I'm covered in juice! Get him!,3,4,42
Mako,We need to get you out of here.,3,4,42
,"Mako pulls Wu by the arm, while Kuvira's supporters chase them. Mako realizes they can't outrun the group, so he creates a wall of fire behind them, blocking their attackers' path, and pulls Wu behind the wall of a shop, which happens to have a vandalized poster of Wu stuck to it.",3,4,42
Wu,"[Gasps.] It's destiny. Look where we are, Mako! The Royal Palace.",3,4,42
,"Wu runs inside, rudely and haphazardly knocking down the trays of various people as he passes. At the far end of the room, he sees a mock-up of the throne; a little boy sits on it, playing with a fake scepter and a fake crown. Wu approaches and promptly tries to steal the scepter from the child.",3,4,42
Little Boy,Hey! It's my birthday!,3,4,42
Wu,"[Wrenches the scepter and the crown away from the boy, also taking the cape from his mother.] It's my coronation day! You'll have another birthday next year, but I'll never have this day back again! Never! [Breaks down into tears.]",3,4,42
Mako,"Okay, you're losing it.",3,4,42
Wu,[Bawling.] This is the worst day of my life!,3,4,42
Mako,"Why? Do you really want to be the king? I mean, Kuvira might be a power-crazed dictator, but at least she spent the last few years working hard to make the Earth Kingdom somewhat better. If you were an Earth Kingdom citizen, do you think you're the kind of person you want as your king? What have you ever done for your people? [Wu looks at him, and Mako realizes what he just said.] I'm sorry, that was out of line.",3,4,42
Wu,"No, you're right. No one ever talked to me like that before. I guess I'm just a joke who got what he deserved.",3,4,42
Mako,[Notices the group that has been chasing them.] Let's get you out of here and back to someplace safe.,3,4,42
Wu,Carry me?,3,4,42
Mako,[Annoyed.] No.,3,4,42
,"Cut back to Korra and Toph. Korra is lying on a bed, and Toph is leaning over her.",3,4,42
Toph,"Okay, if you want me to bend out this metal, you need to relax.",3,4,42
Korra,[Tense.] I am relaxed.,3,4,42
Toph,[Huffing spitefully.] Seriously? Your body is like a twisted tree-trunk!,3,4,42
Korra,Just do it! I'm ready.,3,4,42
,"Toph cracks her fingers, then her shoulders. The second she starts bending the metal in Korra's body, Korra bolts upright in pain, yelling.",3,4,42
Toph,It wouldn't hurt if you would just relax! Stop fighting me!,3,4,42
Korra,I'm not fighting!,3,4,42
,"Korra throws herself back onto the bed. Toph cracks her back and starts bending again. This time, Korra gets the visions of Zaheer suffocating her again. She jolts back into reality, screaming.",3,4,42
Toph,"[Fed up.] All right, that's it. You're going to have to do this yourself. Clearly, you want to keep the metal in there.",3,4,42
Korra,What do you mean? Why would I want poison inside me?,3,4,42
Toph,"I don't know! Maybe so you have an excuse not to go back to being the Avatar. If you don't get better, you can't do your job, so you don't have to worry about getting hurt again!",3,4,42
Korra,Wha‒ That's ridiculous!,3,4,42
Toph,"Whatever. When you want it out, you can bend it out. I can't deal with all your issues for you.",3,4,42
Korra,Wait! What am I supposed to do now?,3,4,42
Toph,"How should I know? Ask the spirit that brought you here. The good news is, if you're looking for a place to hang where no one will bother you, you picked the best swamp in the world!",3,4,42
,Korra lets her head hang. Cut to Air Temple Island.,3,4,42
Tenzin,This ... is a mission of the utmost importance. Conflict is coming to the Earth Kingdom and we need to find the Avatar. [Turns around to face his children.] Can I count on you three to bring Korra home?,3,4,42
Meelo,You can count on one of us. I don't know about these two ladies. [Points to his sisters.],3,4,42
,"Cut to Kuvira's train, where Zhu Li puts a part of the spirit vine, wired to electrical connections and suspended in a glass tube, into a machine of sorts as Kuvira and Varrick watch from overhead.",3,4,42
Kuvira,"From now on, developing this technology is your number one priority.",3,4,42
Varrick,This is going to change everything!.,3,4,42
,End credits.,3,4,42
Shiro Shinobi,"[Narrating a newsreel.] After Korra failed to return to Republic City, everyone has been worried about her fate. So Tenzin tasked Jinora, Ikki and Meelo with finding the Avatar. Unbeknownst to the kids, Korra found refuge in the swamp with Toph, who discovered there was still metal poison in her body, but when Toph tried removing it, Korra resisted. Will the airbender kids find the Avatar and help her return to action?",4,4,43
,"The scene opens with a nature shot, a view of a cliffside punctuated by a narrow cleft. Through the crack, a flock of birds scatters as, in the next moment, a massive Earth Empire airship appears through the void in the rock, cutting through the air close to the ground. Cut to a wide shot, showing the closed parts of Zaofu sitting in the foreground at the head of its narrow valley; Kuvira's airships, in the distance, round the bend in the valley and steer toward the city. As the ships advance on the city, the shot cuts to a guard outpost, where one of the guards, seeing the force bearing down on them, whirls around and rushes to a radio, picking it up and speaking urgently.",5,4,44
Guard,We have an emergency!,5,4,44
,"Shot cuts to Suyin, riding on a train; the frame is focused on her face, facing away from the front window as the train rushes through a tunnel. The shot zooms out, revealing that her twin sons are with her; Baatar walks up to her, grasping a bar for balance as he speaks.",5,4,44
Baatar,[Concerned.] I'll contact President Raiko. He'll send the United Forces.,5,4,44
,"The train emerges into brilliant sunlight as it exits the tunnel. The four of them look into the distance; Kuvira's forces are massed in the valley, both airships and ground troop.",5,4,44
Suyin,"[Stands up and looks at the army.] Call whomever you want, but they'll never make it in time. [Quick zoom on Kuvira's army.] Kuvira's already here and she brought her entire army.",5,4,44
,"After a longer shot of the whole of the force, the shot cuts to the train. Baatar Jr., standing in front of the map of the Earth Kingdom, fixes his cufflinks before turning and joining Kuvira at the window. They look out at the world flying by as the train moves through the countryside.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,"By this time tomorrow, my mother will have signed the treaty, and the Earth Empire will finally be united.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"Don't get ahead of yourself. Securing your hometown won't be like every other city. [She walks over to the map, leaving Baatar Jr. at the window.]",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,"[Turning toward Kuvira, pausing briefly before he speaks; bitter.] Zaofu stopped being my home long ago. I'm ready to take it by force.",5,4,44
Kuvira,No. The eyes of the world are on us now. We must do this right. That's why we need Bolin.,5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,Do you really think we can rely on him?,5,4,44
Kuvira,[Turning back to the map.] Su trusts him. She'll listen to him.,5,4,44
,"The scene cuts to a wide shot of Pepper flying through the air. As Jinora speaks, it zooms, showing Jinora piloting the bison while Korra, Ikki, and Meelo sit back in the saddle.",5,4,44
Jinora,Are you sure we should be going to Zaofu? Dad wanted us to bring you back to Republic City.,5,4,44
Korra,"[As the shot zooms on her.] If Kuvira's heading to Zaofu, so am I. She needs to know that the Avatar is back. [She looks to her left, away from the others.] The world needs to know.",5,4,44
,"Meelo jumps to his feet, yelling as he balances himself on the saddle.",5,4,44
Meelo,Woo-hoo! Avatar fight! This is going to be awesome!,5,4,44
Korra,"[Smiling up at him.] Meelo, there's not gonna be a fight. Kuvira saved my dad. She was a captain in Su's guard; I think she can be reasoned with.",5,4,44
Meelo,What? No fight? Why did we go through all that trouble to save you if you're not going to beat someone up?,5,4,44
,"Quick cut to Kuvira's train, gliding through the mountains on its track. The scene is shown briefly from the perspective of a camera in Varrick's laboratory in the rear car of the train; Varrick himself has his head shoved into the frame; he looks confused.",5,4,44
Varrick,"Zhu Li! Is this thing on? [Withdrawing his head, taking his position in front of the camera.]",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Voice-over.] We're rolling, sir.",5,4,44
Varrick,"Okay. I'm Varrick, of Varrick Industries, International-- [He smiles as he says his name.] --and this is Spirit Vine Experiment 3-02. Hand me the thing!",5,4,44
,"Zhu Li walks into the frame from the right, carrying a glass tube, within which is a fragment of spirit vine. While Zhu Li, dressed in a white lab coat and protective observation goggles, carries the tube easily, Varrick staggers under its weight as she gives it to him. He waddles over to the machine behind him and places the tube in the machine as Zhu Li checks an electrical connection in the wiring on the floor.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Narrating his procedure.] In this stasis capsule is a preserved spirit vine sample weighing approximately two ""Zhu Lis"".",5,4,44
,"Zhu Li casts a glance at the camera as the view cuts away from the camera's point of view; Varrick walks to the right side of the machine and pulls a lever. As he walks back toward the camera, the machine begins to hum, and the vine in the capsule is enveloped by electric pulses of purplish power.",5,4,44
Varrick,"I have postulated that these spirit vines are a form of pure energy that's unstable in what we call-- [Making quote signs with his fingers.] --""typical earth conditions"". [Point of view switches back to the camera.] This machine should transfer the energy from the vine into a battery using electrical currents, reverse magnetic polarity, and a little-known phenomenon I like to call-- [He pushes his face back into the camera.] --the Varri-Effect!",5,4,44
,"The point of view moves out of the camera as Varrick moves to observe his machine. The vine crackles with energy, a high-pitched hum permeating the room, then a separate glass tube above it begins glowing with the same purplish light.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Excitedly.] It's working! It's registering five ""Varricks"" of power. [The glow increases.] Now seven Varricks!",5,4,44
,"As soon as the words leave his mouth, the power conduit leading to the glowing battery overloads, and bolts of energy begin to arc along its surface as Varrick stares at it, dumbstruck. The energy dial suddenly shoots to the top of the scale; the light bulbs on the side of the machine shatter as alarms sound.",5,4,44
Varrick,Whoa! What is this? What's going on?,5,4,44
,"As the hum of the machine rises in pitch, a sudden arc of energy flares from the machine, knocking Zhu Li against the wall with a cry; the point of view jumps back inside the camera as Varrick dives away from the machine. The camera falls onto its side as Varrick yells, climbing toward the camera.",5,4,44
Varrick,Zhu Li! Shut it down! There are too many Varricks!,5,4,44
,"As the point of view leaves the camera once again, Zhu Li rushes to the lever and pulls it, looking up at the arcing battery. Since nothing happens, she pulls the lever a few more times, to no effect. As she stares, panicked, at the intensely glowing battery, it explodes, sending a focused blast of pure energy through the back wall of the train. A quick outside shot shows the entire rear car of the train being thrown into the air by the shock of the blast. Varrick and Zhu Li are both thrown backward, toward the gaping hole in the car. While Varrick hits a piece of wall and crumples to the floor, Zhu Li tumbles through the hole, screaming as she dangles over the tracks flying by in a blur.",5,4,44
Zhu Li,Sir!,5,4,44
,"Varrick crawls to the hole and, grabbing both of her hands, tries to pull her back into the train, groaning.",5,4,44
Varrick,"You're too heavy! You know, you could stand to lose a few Zhu Lis!",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Veiled desperation.] I think you're just weak, sir! Pull harder!",5,4,44
,"With one last great effort, his eyes bulging with the exertion, Varrick pulls Zhu Li back onto the train. He falls backward as Zhu Li, off balance, falls on top of him. As they realize how they are lying, chest to chest, they look at each other for a moment. Zhu Li, a tiny smile on her face, moves her safety goggles onto her forehead as Varrick looks back into her eyes.",5,4,44
Zhu Li,[Softly.] Varrick ... you saved me.,5,4,44
Varrick,"[Putting a hand to her face, speaking softly as well.] Of course I saved you.",5,4,44
,"As he puts his free hand on the other side of her face, he directs her face toward the wreckage of the car, a sudden change in his demeanor from romantic to his eccentric self.",5,4,44
Varrick,I can't clean this place up by myself! [He sits up.] Grab a broom!,5,4,44
,"As he sits up, Zhu Li leans away from him, looking put out. Kuvira and Baatar Jr., having felt the shock of the explosion, enter the room.",5,4,44
Kuvira,What happened? Were we attacked?,5,4,44
Varrick,[Getting to his feet and dusting himself off.] No! We were spirit-vined! But don't worry! I'm putting the kibosh on this project.,5,4,44
,"He slides a lever on the wall down and the greenish light bathing his samples, set into notches in the wall, lessens and goes out.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"No, you're not. Do you realize what we could do with this kind of power?",5,4,44
Varrick,"[As he goes around the room, shutting off the glowing green lights one by one.] Yes! I do! And that's why we gotta put an end to it! What if it fell into the wrong hands?",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,[Arms crossed.] Since when does that matter to you?,5,4,44
Varrick,"[Hushed.] I know, it's not like me, right? Usually I look at a project like this and think, ""Wow! I could make a ton of money off this!"" But recently, I've been having these strange feelings ... inside. [Confused.] It's like I'm ... concerned with others. And there's this nagging voice in my head constantly telling me what's right from wrong!",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Sweeping the floor next to Varrick.] I believe that voice is your conscience, sir.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Unwavering.] Well, I'm the other voice in your head, and I'm telling you you will continue with this project.",5,4,44
Varrick,"Sorry, no. I just really gotta stand my ground on this one-- Whoa!",5,4,44
,"The metal plates that make up the shoulders of his outfit have slid up and tightened around his neck, lifting him into the air. As the frame shifts, Kuvira is shown metalbending. She begins walking him backward, toward the hole in the back of the train.",5,4,44
Kuvira,And now there's a voice in my head telling me to drop you on the tracks. [She floats Varrick out into the emptiness as he yells.] Should I listen?,5,4,44
Varrick,"[Pleading for his life.] No! No! Head voices are liars, what do head voices know? I'll work on the project! Please don't drop me!",5,4,44
,"Kuvira smiles. She pulls Varrick back inside the train and he tumbles to the floor in a heap. She steps over his body as she leaves, Baatar Jr. in tow. Zhu Li rushes to Varrick's side and they both watch their superiors leave, anger etched into their faces. Cut to the Republic City prison building. A zoomed shot shows a stack of letters, their wax seals unbroken, sitting in front of a pair of folded hands. The shot changes to reveal that Asami Sato is sitting at the table, looking down at the letters. A voice breaks the silence and she looks up.",5,4,44
Hiroshi,"Asami, you came.",5,4,44
,"Hiroshi pulls out the chair opposite his daughter and sits, the shot showing a bespectacled, somewhat downfallen face; his hair has gone gray. A moment of silence passes between them as they sit facing each other.",5,4,44
Asami,[Pushing the stack of letters across the table toward Hiroshi.] I came to return these.,5,4,44
Hiroshi,"[Looking at the letters, saddened.] You never opened them.",5,4,44
Asami,Stop writing me. I never want to see or hear from you again. [She rises to leave.],5,4,44
Hiroshi,"[Desperately.] Please, just let me say one thing, then I'll never contact you again.",5,4,44
,"Asami stands still for a moment, then sits back down, not looking her father in the eye.",5,4,44
Hiroshi,"I can't forgive myself for all the horrible things I've done. And I never expect you to forgive me. I tore our family apart, and destroyed our good name. [A flash of regret on his face.] But in a life of regret, you're the one thing I look back on that makes me smile. [Asami averts her head even more. Cut to a panning up shot from behind Asami, showing that she is tearing up.] I just want you to know I'm so proud of you, Asami. You are the greatest thing I ever created.",5,4,44
,"The tear that threatened to spill while Hiroshi was talking, breaks through and rolls over her cheek. Asami quickly rises and runs from the room without saying a word. Hiroshi watches her leave before hanging his head in sadness. Cut to the train, still speeding through the mountains. Bolin sits in a chair, facing Kuvira and Baatar Jr.. He seems apprehensive.",5,4,44
Bolin,Am ... I in trouble?,5,4,44
Kuvira,"No. In fact, I have good news. We want you to be a part of our inner circle.",5,4,44
Bolin,"[Excited.] Inner circle? No way! Yes! [Catching himself, he clears his throat; serious tone.] That is a great honor. What does it mean, exactly?",5,4,44
Kuvira,"It means you've proven your worth. We're so close to uniting the Empire, but Su has some resentment towards me and Baatar that might cloud her judgment and stop her from making a wise decision. We believe you can help her see clearly.",5,4,44
Bolin,"[Eagerly.] I can do that! By the time I'm finished telling her all the great things we've done, she'll be begging to join!",5,4,44
Kuvira,Good. Because we're here.,5,4,44
,"Kuvira metalbends the shades on the windows up, letting outside light pour into the car. Sitting in the bottom of the valley below are Kuvira's forces. Bolin looks at the massive army for a moment before turning back to Kuvira.",5,4,44
Bolin,Aren't all these troops gonna send the wrong message?,5,4,44
Kuvira,The army is here to project strength. You're here to present peace.,5,4,44
,"A wide tracking shot follows the train as it moves on its elevated track toward Zaofu. Cut to inside the city; a set of double doors opens wide and Kuvira, Baatar Jr., and Bolin enter the room. The view zooms out and turns around to reveal Baatar Sr., Suyin, Wei, Wing, Huan, and Opal facing the intruders. Opal, who is sitting on the large table in the center of the room which carries the scale model of Zaofu, stands upon their entrance, her hands on her hips.",5,4,44
Bolin,"[Happy.] Opal! You're here, too! [Trying to embrace her.]",5,4,44
Opal,"[Turning away from him, crossing her arms.] No! You've chosen your side.",5,4,44
Bolin,"Sides? There shouldn't be sides! [To both groups.] I know, why don't we all stand in a circle, huh? Maybe hold hands?",5,4,44
Suyin,[Ignoring Bolin.] I'm not giving up Zaofu. I don't care if you brought your entire army.,5,4,44
Kuvira,"Su, I didn't bring my army to threaten you. I wanted to show you all that your son and I have accomplished.",5,4,44
Suyin,[To Baatar Jr.] You must realize what you're doing goes against everything your father and I tried to teach you.,5,4,44
Baatar,"Son, you belong here.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,[Bitterly.] Why? So that I could go on living in your shadow?,5,4,44
,The view cuts to a side shot of Baatar's look of astonishment and Suyin's visible anger.,5,4,44
Suyin,Don't say that! Can't you see she's brainwashed you!,5,4,44
Kuvira,"[As Baatar Jr. smugly crosses his arms, smirking.] Ha! I didn't brainwash him! I set him free! And now he's accomplished more with me than he ever could with you.",5,4,44
Bolin,"[Laughing awkwardly.] Okay, guys, obviously, there's a lot of personal, painful history here, so what do you say we just all forget about that stuff, huh? I mean, that's the past! [Cut to a shot of Wei and Wing as Bolin slides up into view behind them.] Right Wing? Right Wei? You guys know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right? High five! [He stands between them, offering said high-five to them both for a few seconds before giving up and sliding smoothly out of frame.] All right. No, that's cool. [He walks back to the center of the room.] You know what I think we need to do? Focus on the future! And the future is bright, let me tell you! [Speaking to the Beifong clan.] I've seen it! Yeah! [Chuckling enthusiastically.] Saw it last month! We went to this town that had nothing. Most of the people there had never seen a Satomobile before. Now, they have two Satomobiles, running water, and a magnet train that goes right through their town! I mean, how awesome is that?",5,4,44
Opal,"They might have been happy when you first arrived, but I've seen what happens after you leave. Citizens are forced to work as slave labor, dissenters are sent off to who-knows-where!",5,4,44
Bolin,"You're wrong, Opal! Now, I don't know what you think you've seen, but I am giving you the one-hundred-percent Bolin guarantee that we're making the Earth Empire a better place to live!",5,4,44
Suyin,[Advancing on Kuvira.] I can't believe you brought Bolin here to try and sway us. Leave! Zaofu will never accept you as their leader!,5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Matter-of-factly.] Then you leave me no choice. You have twenty-four hours to agree to join the Empire, or we take the city by force.",5,4,44
,"Quick cut to Bolin, who looks astonished by Kuvira's sudden ultimatum. The scene changes back to Pepper, still airborne. Cut to Korra and Meelo, the latter perched on the front of the saddle, looking into the distance with the aid of a spyglass. He cries out suddenly.",5,4,44
Meelo,"I see it! Zaofu! We made it! [The bison crosses over the ridge into the valley and the army of the Earth Empire unfolds beneath them; voice-over.] And a bunch of other people are here, too.",5,4,44
Korra,"[Staring down at the force.] Oh, no. I hope we're not too late.",5,4,44
,"Cut to the same room as in the previous scene where Korra opens the door, followed by the airbender kids. The family in the room looks at her silently for a moment.",5,4,44
Suyin,"Korra? I can't believe it, where have you been? [Embracing Korra.] You disappeared; everyone was so worried!",5,4,44
Korra,"I'll tell you the whole story later. Right now, I want to help you stop Kuvira. What can I do?",5,4,44
,"The scene changes to Kuvira's tent in the encampment in the valley. Inside, Kuvira sits at her desk, while Baatar Jr. and Bolin stand in front of her. Bolin seems a bit on edge.",5,4,44
Bolin,"You were just bluffing, right? I mean, you're not really gonna attack Zaofu ... are you?",5,4,44
Kuvira,"When people don't cooperate, we must find other ways of convincing them to join.",5,4,44
Bolin,"[Timidly.] Other ... ways? How many ... times have we used these ""other ways"" in the past?",5,4,44
Kuvira,[Standing.] It's not for you to worry about.,5,4,44
Bolin,"So, uh ... what does happen to all those towns and villages after we leave? I just realized I'd never really ... gone back and ... checked on them.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Rising and walking around the table to face Bolin.] Those people are my loyal subjects, and they contribute to the Empire however I see fit. Now that you're in the inner circle, you're going to have to accept some hard truths.",5,4,44
Bolin,"Maybe ... I'm not really an ""inner circle"" kind of guy. Or--or maybe, we don't take over Zaofu! Maybe we can just--let them be on their own, and then, ""Yay! The Empire's united! Congratulations to us!""",5,4,44
,"Bolin falters, cowering as Kuvira advances on him angrily.",5,4,44
Kuvira,I didn't know your personal feelings for Opal were stronger than your loyalty to me. Zaofu will join us. The only thing I'm second-guessing is my decision to bring you along. Maybe you need to spend some time in a reeducation camp.,5,4,44
Bolin,I ... thought that's where we sent people to learn new trade skills.,5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,"[Unsympathetically.] Hard truths, Bolin.",5,4,44
Kuvira,[Menacingly.] Your loyalty seems to be wavering.,5,4,44
Bolin,"[Panicked.] No--no, I'm totally on your side, completely, one-hundred-percent loyal.",5,4,44
,"Bolin gives a hearty salute, while Kuvira, skeptical, glares down at him. Cut to the Zaofu metalbending courtyard, where Korra and Suyin stand in darkness.",5,4,44
Korra,How did things get so bad between you and Kuvira? I thought she was your protégé.,5,4,44
Suyin,"She was more than that. She was like a daughter to me. I took her in when she was eight years old and nourished her talents. Kuvira was smart, a natural leader, and quickly rose through the ranks. I saw myself in her.",5,4,44
Korra,What happened?,5,4,44
Suyin,"[Turning to face Korra.] Three years ago, after the fall of the Earth Queen, Raiko and Tenzin came to see me.",5,4,44
,"The scene sinks into Suyin's memory of the meeting. Suyin and Kuvira stand at the head of the room, while Raiko and Tenzin sit on the sofas on either side of the room.",5,4,44
Raiko,"The Earth Kingdom is in chaos. There's a vacuum of power, and I'm concerned about what will happen if someone doesn't take control of the situation.",5,4,44
Suyin,And you think I should be the one?,5,4,44
Tenzin,"You're the perfect person to take charge. The world leaders trust you, and, as a Beifong, you have credibility in the Earth Kingdom.",5,4,44
Suyin,"I'm honored that you thought of me, but I'm not interested in imposing my ideals on an entire nation. [Behind Suyin, Kuvira's head turns slightly toward the matriarch as she hears her refusal.] I'm afraid I can't help you.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"Suyin, I know this isn't my place, but I think you should do this. Zaofu has always been a beacon of modern progress, and now you can share that with everyone.",5,4,44
Suyin,What would you have me do? March into Ba Sing Se with an army? We'd be seen as conquerors and greeted with nothing but war.,5,4,44
Kuvira,There are already wars. The Earth Queen nearly destroyed our nation. This is our opportunity to change things.,5,4,44
Suyin,[Fiercely stern.] It's not going to happen.,5,4,44
,"As Suyin turns away from Kuvira, her face fills with hurt, then ices over with resolve. In the present, Suyin is still speaking to Korra, but the scene stays in the past, where Suyin is walking across a vast platform toward a line of airships.",5,4,44
Suyin,"[Voice-over.] I didn't realize it at the time, but that moment put a rift between us. Kuvira turned my own son against me, and together they plotted behind my back.",5,4,44
,"Kuvira and Baatar Jr. are standing near the airships, taking boxes on board. As Baatar Jr. walks away, Suyin walks up behind Kuvira.",5,4,44
Suyin,What do you think you're doing?,5,4,44
Kuvira,[Without turning around.] We're doing what you don't have the guts to do: We're going to Ba Sing Se to help bring order back to the Earth Kingdom.,5,4,44
Suyin,[Furious.] No! You will stay here!,5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Calmly turning to face Suyin.] And who's going to stop me? Your security force was more than happy to join my cause. They're some of the best fighters in the world, and they are tired of being treated like exotic birds in your cage.",5,4,44
Suyin,"If you leave now, you will never be welcomed back.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"When I choose to return, it'll be on my own terms.",5,4,44
,"As Suyin speaks in the present again, the shot shows the propellers of the airships beginning to spin. The shot changes to Suyin watching as her airships rise into the sky, then fades back to the present.",5,4,44
Suyin,"[Voice-over.] Kuvira and Baatar left that day with Varrick, my security force, and a few of Zaofu's wealthiest citizens. After Kuvira proved herself by stabilizing Ba Sing Se, [Cut back to Korra and Suyin in the present.] Raiko and the other world leaders made her the provisional head of the Earth Kingdom. When she refused to step down, I knew it was only a matter of time before she made her way back here.",5,4,44
Korra,I want to fix this.,5,4,44
Suyin,You can. Go into the Avatar State and demolish her entire army. Remove Kuvira from power once and for all.,5,4,44
Korra,[Seeming reluctant.] Fighting is something the old me would do. That always made things worse. Let me talk with Kuvira. Maybe I can reason with her.,5,4,44
Suyin,[Adamant.] Kuvira doesn't listen to reason.,5,4,44
,"The scene moves to Avatar Korra Park in Republic City; a variety of different people are doing exercises on mats, walking and talking, or sitting under the statue of Korra which stands in the center of the area. Asami sits on a bench, alone. Hunched over, she sits up straight and looks at the two people at a stone table in front of her. A young girl, dressed in green, is playing Pai Sho with her father. She makes a few moves with a tile, then sits back and smiles at him. The man reaches over and takes his daughter in his arms. Asami smiles softly. The scene cuts to Varrick's workshop, where Varrick is leaned over the railing on the upper level, as Zhu Li stands behind him, making tea.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Angrily.] I can't believe Kuvira locked me in here like a prisoner! I'm not feeling well! I think I'm running out of air! Zhu Li, hold your breath!",5,4,44
Zhu Li,[Calmly pouring tea.] I'm not holding my breath.,5,4,44
Varrick,[Exasperated.] Great! Now we're both gonna die!,5,4,44
,"As Varrick hangs his head, a noise of creaking metal and a whisper permeate the room; Varrick lifts his head.",5,4,44
Bolin,[Whispering.] Varrick? Varrick?!,5,4,44
Varrick,Ahh! And the head voices are back!,5,4,44
,"Varrick is looking at Zhu Li, who points a finger up at the ceiling. Varrick turns his head up and sees Bolin's head poking through a hatch in the top of the car.",5,4,44
Varrick,Bolin! Thank goodness you're here! Where did that hatch come from? Forget the hatch! There's something important I gotta tell ya!,5,4,44
Bolin,"Well, there's something important I gotta tell you, too!",5,4,44
,"He falls through the hatch, landing on his feet, and as he turns to Varrick. They both take each other's shoulders in a fervent panic.",5,4,44
Varrick and Bolin,[Simultaneously.] Kuvira's crazy!,5,4,44
,"They stare at each other for a split second, then talk frantically.",5,4,44
Bolin,How'd you find out?,5,4,44
Varrick,"When I refused to build her a superweapon, she threatened my life!",5,4,44
Bolin,"She threatened me, too! And she's threatening Zaofu and it turns out, she's been threatening villages this whole time! [The men let each other go.] We gotta get outta here.",5,4,44
Varrick,"I couldn't agree more, kid.",5,4,44
,"Varrick motions to Zhu Li with a finger. As Bolin watches, she mounts a table next to the wall and jumps up through the hatch. Varrick walks toward Bolin, his hands raised. Zhu Li's hands appear above Varrick, grasp his hands, and pull him upward in a flash. Bolin promptly mounts the same table Zhu Li used and makes his own escape through the hatch. The view changes to a wide shot of the encampment before focusing on Korra, who is walking with Baatar Jr. They stop, and Baatar Jr. speaks.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,We have an unexpected guest. The Avatar is here to see you.,5,4,44
,The view pans left to show Kuvira standing with two of her soldiers. She nods to them and they leave her. She then turns and walks over to Korra.,5,4,44
Kuvira,"Korra, it's such an honor to see you again. The last I heard, you were still healing in the South Pole.",5,4,44
Korra,"Well, I'm feeling much better now.",5,4,44
Kuvira,That's wonderful news.,5,4,44
Korra,I'm here to ask you to back down. Please. Take your army and leave.,5,4,44
Kuvira,I think we both know that's not going to happen.,5,4,44
,"The two women exchange a long, inhospitable stare.",5,4,44
Korra,I can't let you take Zaofu.,5,4,44
Kuvira,"Look, I was tasked with bringing stability to the Earth Kingdom. Zaofu is the last holdout. Why should I treat it differently than any other state?",5,4,44
Korra,What you're doing isn't right!,5,4,44
Kuvira,"I understand you're just trying to do Su a favor, but you can't come to me as I am on the verge of reuniting my nation and tell me to stop. The world was descending into chaos while you were gone. [Korra hangs her head.] In order to fix it, I had to make some tough decisions.",5,4,44
Korra,I know what that's like. I've had plenty of people mad at me about decisions I've made.,5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Walking up and putting a hand on Korra's shoulder.] Exactly. Korra, if you really want to help, go back to Su and try to talk some sense into her. Let's call a temporary truce. I won't make any moves until you talk to her and get back to me.",5,4,44
Korra,[Agreeing.] Maybe that will be for the best.,5,4,44
,"Cut to the platform, where Baatar Jr. walks up to the door of Varrick's cart, guarded by two soldiers.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,Have you seen Bolin?,5,4,44
Guard #1,"He came by to see Varrick, but we turned him away.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,[He gets a suspicious look in his face.] Open the door.,5,4,44
,"Cut to inside the cart, where Baatar Jr. and the two guards stare at the still-open ceiling hatch.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,We have some fugitives to catch.,5,4,44
,"Cut to just the mountains bordering Kuvira's camp, with the army and Zaofu in the background. Three mecha tanks walk uphill, away from the army. One of them stops and turns around, watching over the camp, and tries to come up with a strategy.",5,4,44
Bolin,"Okay, I say we go up and around the mountains-- [Opens helmet.] --and sneak into Zaofu from the rear.",5,4,44
,"Varrick and Zhu Li also stop, turn around and open their helmets.",5,4,44
Varrick,"We're not going to Zaofu, that place is doomed! We gotta head to Republic City!",5,4,44
Bolin,"What? No, nonono, we gotta help here.",5,4,44
Varrick,We'll be helping by warning the world about Kuvira's potential superweapon!,5,4,44
Bolin,"[Doubtful.] Well, that's helping, but it's a completely different type of helping. [Bringing the arm of the mecha tank up to his chin.] Hmm. Let me think about this.",5,4,44
,"He suddenly gets zapped by lightning and tumbles off his feet. Three mecha tanks are charging down on them, one of them piloted by Baatar Jr.. He lunges toward Varrick, who lets out a yell and ducks back into the safety of his cockpit. Zhu Li steps in front of him, arms raised. A massive cloud of dust rises as Baatar Jr. lands with crushing force. As it clears, Zhu Li stands firm, holding his fist back with both hands, having caught Baatar Jr.'s attack. He is tackled by Bolin, leaving Varrick and Zhu Li free to fend off the other two tanks. With a ferocious snarl on her face, Zhu Li's helmet slams shut, before boxing with one of the other mecha tanks and knocking it backward. She shoots a bola and catches the other tank off guard as it was charging at Varrick, who is lying on the ground, his helmet opening and closing quickly.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Slamming a metal hand against the helmet, trying to get it to work.] That's not the flamethrower! What idiot designed these things?",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"You did, sir!",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Pointing in Zhu Li's direction.] Less lecturing, more saving my life!",5,4,44
,"She turns just in time to catch a punch from a tank in the head, hard enough to make her fly backward a good distance. To stop sliding, she jams a spike into the ground and uses her momentum to swing around on one leg, kicking the other tank in the chest with enough force to throw it into a tree. The shot pans around to show Baatar Jr. throwing Bolin's tank around. Baatar Jr. uses the hand piston to punch Bolin's tank onto its back temporarily. Bolin is slightly groggy from the blow, but quickly regains his senses and sees Baatar Jr. leap for him. He opens the tank, rolling out a split second before Baatar Jr. lands and completely crushes the suit. Bolin earthbends at Baatar Jr., but the former uses cables to jump out of the way of the flying stones. Twisting in midair, Baatar Jr. retracts one of the cables, allowing his free arm to operate the flamethrower. Bolin rolls out of the way of the stream of fire and bends up some cover for himself. In the background, Zhu Li is holding off the other two pilots on her own, while her boss is up in a tree, struggling with the controls of the mecha tank.",5,4,44
Varrick,Hey! I think I figured it out!,5,4,44
,"Zhu Li throws away one of her attackers and Varrick aims to shoot him with lightning, but shoots Zhu Li instead, knocking her over.",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Tiresome.] Sir, you're making this very difficult.",5,4,44
,"She is picked up and thrown around, while to scene goes back to Baatar Jr. and Bolin, who is still covering from Baatar Jr.'s flamethrower. Bolin launches the boulder at his former boss, giving him time to roll away and uproot a big tree, bringing it down on Baatar Jr. Meanwhile, Varrick is forced to flee his tank as it was entangled by a bola and in the clutches of an enemy tank. As he tumbles out, the other pilot throws Varrick's abandoned suit down and gives chase. Camera pans to the right where Zhu Li is gaining the upper hand now that she only has one opponent. She punches him back and launches cables into the ground around him, reeling herself in to kick her opponent hard. She opens her helmet and sees that Varrick is being chased up a mountain by the other mecha tank. She shoots a cable around a boulder, launching it at the mecha tank attacking Varrick, successfully knocking the suit off the cliff. Zhu Li moves in to knock him out permanently, but a bolt of lightning strikes her, knocking her down. Scenes cuts to a frontal shot of Zhu Li's former opponent charging at her while Varrick's aggressor gets up as well. Bolin, who was on higher ground, jumps off a small cliff, yelling angrily, and uses his lavabending to trap the two other tanks who were fighting Zhu Li. Zhu Li manages to jump out of the way of the wave of lava in the nick of time and her opponents are forced to abandon their vehicles as they melt into the lava. As Bolin traps them with earthbending against the wall, Baatar Jr.'s voice rights out and the camera pans upward to reveal him standing on the cliff, the visor of his tank down, holding Varrick by the head over the edge of the cliff.",5,4,44
Baatar Jr.,"Stop! Turn yourself over, or else ...",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Angrily.] Thanks a lot, Zhu Li.",5,4,44
,"Zhu Li's face contorts in anger as she averts her gaze, gritting her teeth. The scene cuts back to the prison where Asami is sitting at a table; a guard is escorting Hiroshi into the room. He sits at her table.",5,4,44
Hiroshi,You came back.,5,4,44
Asami,"When I first came here, it was because I wanted to tell you face to face that I never wanted to see or hear from you again. I wanted my words to hurt you so that you would know how you hurt me.",5,4,44
Hiroshi,I'm sorry.,5,4,44
Asami,"But when I saw you, it wasn't anger I felt. It was sadness. You tainted our past and destroyed our future together.",5,4,44
Hiroshi,I want to make amends.,5,4,44
Asami,I'm not sure I'll ever be able to forgive you. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try.,5,4,44
,She reaches down to her bag and pulls out a small Pai Sho board.,5,4,44
Asami,I thought we could play some Pai Sho. Like we used to.,5,4,44
Hiroshi,[A smile appears on his face.] Nothing ... would make me happier.,5,4,44
,"Fade away while they start their game. Cut to Kuvira's camp, where Baatar Jr. leads Varrick, Zhu Li, and Bolin through a doorway. The troopers push them through the entrance and they find themselves, to their horror, facing a furious Kuvira.",5,4,44
Bolin,[Terrified.] Don't ... torture us.,5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Stands up and leans on her desk.] Send these three away on the next train. Bolin and Zhu Li will be going to the reeducation camp for our most severe dissenters. [Walks up close to Varrick.] And you will continue work on the spirit-energy project, under close, armed supervision. I want it weaponized immediately. [Turns her back on the three deserters, walking back to her desk.]",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Walks forward and falls on her knees, begging.] Please! Have mercy on me! Don't send me away! Take me back!",5,4,44
Kuvira,"[After a moment's hesitation, turning to look at the figure below her.] Why would I?",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Penitently.] Because my only mistake was being loyal to the wrong person. I was blindly devoted to Varrick, and I looked past all the times he ridiculed me, or ordered me around, or made me clean his disgusting feet-- [Looking angry at the mention of the last instance.] --because I thought he possessed the most brilliant mind in the world. But when I met you, I realized I was wrong. Compared to you, Varrick's a fool.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Insulted.] Hey, come on! I'm right here!",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"I believe in everything you've done, and I believe in your vision. I want to devote my life to you. I pledge my allegiance to you, Great Uniter.",5,4,44
Kuvira,"[Stares at Zhu Li before addressing Varrick and Bolin.] You two could learn something from her. Rise, Zhu Li. I'll give you another chance.",5,4,44
Varrick,"[Astonished, to Zhu Li.] Think about what you're doing! We're partners! We have history!",5,4,44
Zhu Li,"[Angrily.] I did everything you ever asked of me, and you never appreciated it! [Points to the exit.] Guards, do the thing!",5,4,44
Varrick,[As the troopers grab him and pull him outside.] No! Not the thing! Zhu Li!,5,4,44
,"The door slams shut as Varrick and the guards exit. Cut to Suyin's garden in Zaofu, where Baatar is anxiously pacing back and forth. Korra runs up to him.",5,4,44
Korra,Where's Su? I have to talk to her.,5,4,44
Baatar,[Worriedly.] She's not here. She took Wing and Wei. They're going to sneak into Kuvira's camp and put an end to this.,5,4,44
Korra,[Visibly distressed.] No!,5,4,44
,Roll credits.,5,4,44
,"Night has fallen over Kuvira's encampment outside Zaofu as the scene opens. A light breeze ruffles the flag over Kuvira's quarters and the small building is surrounded by mecha tanks. As the scene cuts to the side of the valley, the siege force and Zaofu itself can both be seen in the background. A lone guard patrols a path in the darkness. As he sweeps the flashlight beam left and right, a piece of metal suddenly flies from the brush on his left and covers his mouth. He staggers, unable to yell, the flashlight tumbling away from his hand through the air. A metal whip cracks out at him, fastening around his ankles and dragging him into the brush. The frame pans up to show three cables fastening themselves to a tree branch above; three figures, dressed in black, rise into the tree, the cables in their hands. Suyin, Wei, and Wing come to rest on the same branch, staring down at the encampment below. Wing, on Suyin's right, turns to speak in a hushed tone to his mother.",6,4,45
Wing,"Are you sure this will work? Even without Kuvira, they could still crush us.",6,4,45
Suyin,"Most of this army has been forced into service by Kuvira. If we take her out, they'll have no reason to fight. Tonight [She raises a black hood over her head, covering everything except her eyes.] we end her reign of terror.",6,4,45
,"Cut to within the encampment; a mecha tank on patrol marches past a tank as the view pans down, revealing that Suyin and her sons are hiding underneath it. They quickly scramble out from their hiding place and take off through the maze of tanks. As a beam of light from a watchtower sweeps past, they take cover behind another tank. When the beam has passed, they advance, finally coming to a stop behind a few stacks of boxes very near Kuvira's hut. As another mecha tank passes, Suyin peers through a crack between boxes at the hut, still guarded by mecha tanks. Stepping back, she stomps forcefully on the ground, using seismic waves to see past the obstacles in front of them. The waves radiate outward, traveling past the mecha tanks and throughout the hut, where Kuvira is asleep in bed. Cut back to Suyin and the twins.",6,4,45
Suyin,[Whispering.] She's alone in there. Now's our chance!,6,4,45
,"The three simultaneously bend the earth beneath themselves, twisting on the spot and disappearing into holes below them. As the scene cuts to the interior of the hut, three holes open in the thin metal of the floor and the cloaked figures rise through them. Bending cables from her hands, Suyin, in the middle, wraps the sleeping figure tightly with them, before rolling her over to look at her face. The terrified face, however, does not belong to Kuvira.",6,4,45
Zhu Li,Don't hurt me!,6,4,45
Suyin,[Taking off her mask in surprise.] Zhu Li?,6,4,45
,"Suddenly, a siren blares outside; the central support pole withdraws into the ground as the metal sides of the tent fall away and spotlights shine down on the three figures as soldiers and mecha tanks surround them. Kuvira steps from between two mecha tanks.",6,4,45
Kuvira,"I knew you'd try a sneak attack. [Wide shot of the soldiers and the four on the pad of the former tent.] You were afraid to step up and lead the Earth Kingdom when you had the chance. [Cut to a close-up of Kuvira's face.] You were afraid to join me when I became the leader, and now, you're afraid of a fair fight. [Cut to Suyin, ready to fight, before cutting back to Kuvira as she walks away.] You've always been a coward. Take them!",6,4,45
,"As the two mecha tanks between which Kuvira walks shoot lightning at the intruders, the scene cuts to the exterior of Zaofu's many domes, followed by the square inside, where Jinora, Opal, and Korra are talking to each other.",6,4,45
Jinora,"Korra, you have to go stop Su before she does something terrible.",6,4,45
Opal,"Stop her, we should be helping her.",6,4,45
Korra,"We have no idea where your mom is, or what her plan is. If we go charging into Kuvira's camp, we could get them all captured, or worse. All we can do now is wait.",6,4,45
,Opal looks down in dismay. The speakers around Zaofu go on.,6,4,45
Kuvira,"Attention citizens of Zaofu. Your leader, Su Beifong, attempted to attack me tonight while I slept, ignoring the terms of our truce. Luckily, I now have her and her assault team in custody.",6,4,45
Opal,No.,6,4,45
Kuvira,"Rest assured that I will not take revenge on the peaceful citizens of Zaofu, unless your remaining representatives meet me outside the city at dawn to offer the full and unconditional surrender of your city. That is all.",6,4,45
,"As Kuvira's voice fades, Opal turns toward Korra, furious.",6,4,45
Opal,"Korra, you can't let Kuvira get away with this! We have to go break out Mom and my brothers!",6,4,45
Jinora,[Irked by Opal's aggressive stance.] You swore an oath of non-aggression when you became an airbender. [Narrows her eyes; sternly.] You can't just attack Kuvira!,6,4,45
Opal,I don't care about the oath! I have to save my family!,6,4,45
Korra,"[Putting a hand on Opal's shoulder.] No, Jinora is right. Your mom attacked the camp. Kuvira was just defending herself.",6,4,45
Opal,"[Angrily shrugging Korra's hand off her.] ""Defending herself""? She was going to attack our city! I can't believe you're refusing to fight!",6,4,45
,"The doors of a house behind the group open and Meelo and Ikki emerge wearing nightclothes, having been woken by Kuvira's announcement.",6,4,45
Meelo,[Rubbing his eyes tiredly.] Why is that loudspeaker lady talking when I'm trying to sleep?,6,4,45
Baatar,"Korra, what are we going to do?",6,4,45
Korra,"[As Huan walks up behind Opal.] Jinora and I will go talk to Kuvira at dawn, and, maybe, we can work something out. I promise, I'll do everything I can to keep the peace.",6,4,45
Opal,[After a moment's hesitation.] I'll go with you.,6,4,45
Ikki,"We'll go, too.",6,4,45
Jinora,"No! Dad told us to find Korra, and we did. Now you need to stay safe.",6,4,45
Ikki,Come on! Let us help!,6,4,45
Korra,"I can't risk anyone else being captured. You can stay with Baatar and Huan while I work things out with Kuvira. [To Baatar, behind the two children.] Make sure they get back to Tenzin if anything goes wrong. [Baatar nods.]",6,4,45
Meelo,"[Upset.] Aw, man! When am I gonna see some action?",6,4,45
,"Cut to an Earth Empire train speeding along its elevated railway in the mountains, followed by Varrick's face, as he lies on the floor, apparently having a nightmare.",6,4,45
Varrick,"[Mumbling.] Cookie ... jar ... empty. No ... hot ... towels! Waxy ... buildup! [Suddenly bolting upright, yelling.] Zhu Li!",6,4,45
,"The scene shifts as Varrick fully wakes up, showing the interior of a prison car; Varrick is occupying one of the several cells. To Varrick's right, Bolin stirs briefly as Varrick looks around, downcast.",6,4,45
Varrick,Oh ... she really is gone.,6,4,45
,"As he pulls himself into a sitting position, the doors at the end of the car slide open. Baatar Jr. and two other guards walk up to his cell.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,"Up and at 'em, Varrick! Time to go to work. [One of the guards unlocks the cell door.] We have another lab set up for you. [The guards slide the door open.] Kuvira wants the spirit vine weapon operational as soon as possible.",6,4,45
Varrick,Zhu Li always greeted me in the morning with a [A smile crosses his face as he stares vacantly at the wall.] a hot cup of tea.,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,"[As a guard seizes Varrick by the shoulders, pulling him upright.] You'll get your tea when you start working.",6,4,45
Varrick,"Well, I'm really only productive for about fifteen minutes a day, usually in the afternoon around three-forty-five.",6,4,45
,"The guard glances at Baatar Jr., who nods. The guard slams Varrick roughly into the wall behind him as Baatar Jr. continues.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,You'll work now. I want you to show me how the device works.,6,4,45
,"A yawn from Baatar Jr.'s left interrupts the conversation; Bolin is in a sitting position, rubbing his eyes.",6,4,45
Bolin,What's goin' on?,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Go back to sleep. We only need Varrick. You'll need your energy when you get to the re-education camp.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Suddenly emphatic.] I can't be expected to work without an assistant! Without Zhu Li, I'm helpless!",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[As the frame zooms on his face.] One of the guards will be your assistant. I'll be supervising.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Glancing at the guard next to him.] Well, I guess he'll be fine. As long as he doesn't need his hands afterwards! [Chuckling as he finishes.]",6,4,45
Guard #1,"[Turning to Baatar Jr.; nervously.] What's he talking about, sir?",6,4,45
Varrick,"[Sliding slowly across the floor toward the guard.] The last time we worked with the spirit vines, it created an uncontrollable blast [The guard's eyes widen as Varrick continues.] that burned through a wall and could still be blowing up comets in space, as far as I know! I wouldn't want to assist me if I were you!",6,4,45
,"The guard turns his head toward Baatar Jr., pausing for a moment before speaking.",6,4,45
Guard #1,Maybe we should just let the kid help him out.,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[Sighing.] Fine. Bolin can assist.,6,4,45
Bolin,"[Panicking as the guards advance on him.] Wait, what? I need my hands! [Stalling, tucking his hands under his armpits.] Uh, hold on! Can we have breakfast first? [Feebly.] While we still have hands?",6,4,45
,"The guards pull a dejected Bolin out of the cell by his collar. Cut to the valley floor in Zaofu, where Kuvira's army stands ready for battle, their banners flapping in a brisk wind. The figures of Korra, Opal, and Jinora walk toward the front line, where a single figure, detached from the rest, stands waiting for them. A shot of Kuvira shifts its focus from her to Suyin, Wei, and Wing imprisoned in massive steel cases behind her. The three moving figures stop and Opal calls out angrily.",6,4,45
Opal,Release them now!,6,4,45
Kuvira,"If Su agrees to bow to me and turn over Zaofu, she and the rest of your family will not be harmed.",6,4,45
Suyin,[Vehemently.] Never! I'll never bow to you!,6,4,45
Korra,[As Jinora and Opal look worried.] There must be some way for us to resolve this!,6,4,45
Kuvira,"I've already laid out my terms, and I think they're very reasonable. After all, Su did try to take me out during our peaceful negotiations.",6,4,45
Wei,"You call bringing an army to threaten our city ""peaceful""?",6,4,45
Opal,[Cut to a long side shot.] Where's Bolin? I know he would never go along with this!,6,4,45
Kuvira,"Bolin is with my fiancé, working on something very important. [Cut to a close-up of an angered Opal.] But, I assure you, he's on board with my plans. You two have been apart for some time. I guess you don't realize how much Bolin has grown up. [Cut to a close-up of Kuvira.] Now turn over Zaofu.",6,4,45
Korra,I can't just let you take the city!,6,4,45
Kuvira,"[Sternly.] Avatar Korra, you are interfering with internal Earth Empire business, and letting your personal feelings get in the way of reason. Zaofu cannot continue to rule itself. They have been hoarding their riches and technology too long. I'm here to distribute those resources fairly throughout the nation. This is about equality.",6,4,45
Opal,You don't care about equality! This is about control! [To Korra.] Just take her down! You know it's the right thing to do! You have to stop this!,6,4,45
Kuvira,The only way you're going to keep me from marching into Zaofu is if you physically stop me. Now what are you going to do?,6,4,45
Korra,It looks like you're not giving me a choice.,6,4,45
Kuvira,"[Smiling.] Fine. [Aerial shot; addressing her troops.] I want you all to know that I would never ask any of you to do something that I'm not willing to do myself. [Frontal shot, panning to the left, of the lines of infantry.] So, rather than risk your lives, I will fight the Avatar one-on-one. [Frontal shot of Korra.] Korra, if you win, then you can do whatever you want with Zaofu. [Side-shot of Kuvira.] But after I beat you, I want you out of my business for good. I'm the one who brought peace to the Earth Empire, not you. You're not relevant here anymore.",6,4,45
Korra,"[Smiling smugly.] Fine. [Serious expression.] You wanna fight the Avatar? Then let's finish this, right here, right now.",6,4,45
,"The shot slowly closes in on Kuvira's serious face. Cut to an aerial overview from behind Korra, Opal, and Jinora. The two parties stand facing each other silently for a moment. Cut to a close-up of Suyin, Wei, and Wing and on of Kuvira standing stoically with her hands behind her back, watching Korra. Frontal shot of Korra, who looks determined, and the two airbenders. Opal glares at the army. As Jinora speaks, Korra glances down at her.",6,4,45
Jinora,Are you really ready to fight her?,6,4,45
Korra,"Just stay back and let me handle this. [Smiling smugly.] It's been a while, [Smile fades into fury.] but I got a lot of pent-up rage.",6,4,45
Opal,Don't mess around! [Quick cut to Kuvira's stony face; voice-over.] Kuvira is too good! Just go into the Avatar State and get it over with!,6,4,45
Korra,"No, I'm only going to use that as a last resort.",6,4,45
Jinora,[Putting a hand on Korra's arm.] Be careful.,6,4,45
,"As Opal and Jinora leave Korra, retreating to a safe distance, Korra cracks her neck and takes up a fighting stance. Kuvira steps forward to challenge Korra.",6,4,45
Kuvira,Use whatever you want: all the elements; the Avatar State; anything you need. [Smirking as she takes up her own battle stance.] I know you're a little rusty.,6,4,45
Korra,Enough talk!,6,4,45
,"The Avatar fires two jets of flame at Kuvira, who sidesteps the first and ducks under the second, slightly off guard. She spins back around to face Korra, who, jumping toward her opponent, flings an arc of fire at her. Kuvira dodges again as another blast of flame misses her. Korra bends a stone up at Kuvira's face, but she swings her head out of the way barely in time. Dodging another fiery punch, she very rapidly bends a slab of earth between her and Korra, breaking the Avatar's attack and pushing her arm up, leaving her side unprotected. Utilizing the opening she created in Korra's defenses, she bends a chunk of rock right in Korra's stomach. As the Avatar stumbles back, she flings two metal clasps at Korra's extended wrist and ankle and uses them to fling her tumbling through the air. Korra crashed to the ground, tumbling to a stop and momentarily unmoving. The soldiers in Kuvira's army cheer loudly, though as the frame rolls right, it shows Zhu Li, who is standing on the front line, is clapping unenthusiastically with a disinterested look on her face. Kuvira straightens up, laughing as she resumes her fighting pose.",6,4,45
Kuvira,Looks like the Avatar's a little off her game!,6,4,45
,"Korra struggles to get to her feet; as she finally rises, Opal calls out to her.",6,4,45
Opal,Don't let her get you frustrated! She wants you to make a mistake!,6,4,45
,"Korra launches a fissure at Kuvira, but she rolls out of its way and also dodges Korra's airbending attack. The Avatar launches herself into the air and shoots an air blast at Kuvira, which she dodges once again. Korra shoots fire, but the metalbender moves the earth under Korra, causing her to lose balance, and knocks her down with a rock to the chest. Korra shoots a couple more fire and air blasts, but Kuvira dodges them all and traps Korra's foot in a fissure before blinding her with a metal band and hitting her again with a rock. Tearing the metal from her face, Korra rises to her feet once more, firing another fire blast at a waiting Kuvira. Cut to an outside shot of Kuvira's train, racing through a valley, then another cut to the train's interior, where Varrick is working on the spirit vine project under supervision of Baatar Jr.. Varrick is holding out a hand to Bolin, who stands behind him.",6,4,45
Varrick,"Bolin, do the thing.",6,4,45
Bolin,What thing?,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Agitated, whirling around to yell at Bolin.] The thing! I never had to tell Zhu Li what thing!",6,4,45
Bolin,"I'm not Zhu Li, okay? Pretend I don't know anything about anything that's happening here, also pretend I don't want to build a super weapon or get my hands blown off!",6,4,45
,"Varrick walks over to the table and grabs a pair of pliers, demonstratively showing them to Bolin, before continuing his work on the stasis capsule. Baatar Jr. walks in a little closer, eyeing his work.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Walk me through what you're doing. I want to know every detail of your work.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Puts a hand on Baatar Jr.'s chest and slightly shoves him away.] You know, when I started working with the vines, [Uses the pliers to tinker with the machine.] the point was to find a clean, unlimited source of energy, not develop some spirity death ray.",6,4,45
Bolin,[Enters the frame and poking his head into the conversation as Baatar Jr. turns his head to face Bolin. Enthusiastically.] Clean energy! Sounds great! Who doesn't like that stuff? Let's do that instead!,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,"[Annoyed.] Quiet! You're here to help, not talk. [Bolin walks back and Baatar Jr. turns to Varrick again.] And you of all people, should realize that once a discovery is made, it is our responsibility as scientists [Cut to a close-up of Baatar Jr.] to pursue it as far as we can. [Raises an eyebrow.] Wherever it leads.",6,4,45
Varrick,[Sarcastically.] How would you know? You couldn't discover a wolfbat if it was building a nest in your butt.,6,4,45
,Bolin chuckles in the background.,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[Angry.] You're pathetic. [Turns around and crosses his arms.] Wolfbats don't build nests.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Sarcastically.] Ooh. You got me there, Dr. Science. You'll never know how it feels to give birth to genius, only to have it kidnapped, and raised by fools!",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,"Are you done with your rambling, or do the guards need to encourage you to continue your work? [Guard starts to approach Varrick.]",6,4,45
Varrick,"[Raises hands in surrender.] Okay, okay, [Walks back to the vine.] The last time we ran the current through the vine [Winking at Bolin out of Baatar Jr.'s view as he walks past Bolin.] we couldn't control the power, so I'm trying something new to see if I can direct it.",6,4,45
,"Quick cut to Bolin, who looks confused by the wink. Cut back to Kuvira and Korra fighting. The Great Uniter dodges a couple of blasts from Korra, before shooting a few metal plates at her, all of which miss Korra. The Avatar launches herself high into the air and tries to land a hit on Kuvira from there, but is knocked down again. She gets back up, but continues to fail landing a hit on Kuvira. The metalbender traps her hand in a plate, launching her far away again. Kuvira shoots a few rocks, but Korra throws up a wall of cover for herself; the two opponents push the wall back and forth in an attempt to knock the other down, to no avail. While Korra is holding the boulder at bay, close to herself, Kuvira disintegrates the rock, causing Korra to fall to her knees.",6,4,45
Kuvira,"[Smugly.] Come on, Avatar, get up! Show me what you've got!",6,4,45
,"Quick cut to Opal and Jinora, watching Korra uncertainly. Opal suddenly rushes forward.",6,4,45
Opal,We have to help her!,6,4,45
Korra,"[On the ground, she raises her head, yelling across the field of battle to Opal.] No! Stay back! I can handle this.",6,4,45
,"Kuvira gets back in a fighting stance, smiling as she does. Cut back to the train, where Bolin is playing with a screwdriver and Baatar is closely studying the spirit vine weapon.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,"So I see how the current interacts with the vine, and here is a kind of directional tube, but that is baffling here at the base. It looks like that would only redirect the energy back where it came from. And what's that piece of equipment you're fiddling with now on the power source?",6,4,45
Varrick,"[To Bolin, without looking.] Hand me the ... screw-turn-thingy, would ya?",6,4,45
Bolin,"Ugh, I can't believe you're helping them, you know this isn't right. [Hands Varrick the screwdriver.]",6,4,45
Varrick,"Funny story, Bolin. I first got the idea for harnessing spirit power when I watched that giant Unalaq-monster attack the city from my jail cell. That giant monster set me free! [Turns to Bolin with a meaningful look on his face.] Trust me, kid, I know what I'm doing. [Bolin gets a baffled look on his face, Varrick gets up.] That ought to do it. [Nothing happens.] Huh. [Taps the machine.] Okay, stand back. [Walks back a few steps. Bolin moves out of the way. Baatar Jr. raises his eyebrow and nervously steps back. Gives the machine a good, hard kick and it comes to life, glowing purple all around, and a ticking sound is heard. Raises his arms in triumph.] There we go!",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,What's that ticking?,6,4,45
Varrick,That's the timer.,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[Cut to a close-up of a suspicious Baatar Jr. as he looks unamused.] The timer for what?,6,4,45
Varrick,"For the bomb, of course!",6,4,45
Bolin,[Worried.] What?! What bomb?,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Matter-of-factly.] The bomb that's gonna explode in five minutes and destroy this entire train, all of the spirit vines, and everything else within a few hundred yards.",6,4,45
,"As Bolin looks around the train in a panic, Varrick addresses Baatar Jr. with a smug smile; Baatar Jr.'s expression grow progressively more angry as Varrick continues.",6,4,45
Varrick,"You know what, I'd get out of here if I were you. This is the first time I've built a timer and it might run a little fast. Bolin and I are ready to go down with the ship, or train, in this case, but you seem like you have a lot to live for.",6,4,45
,"By now, Baatar Jr.'s face bears a look of barely suppressed rage. Bolin, meanwhile, is completely panicked.",6,4,45
Bolin,"Nononono! I'm not ready to go down with the ship, or the train!",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,You're bluffing.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Speaking calmly.] Stick around five minutes and you'll find out who's bluffing. [Shouting.] You'll be sorry you left me, Zhu Li! When they write the history books, your name will be synonymous with betrayal! People will say, ""Hey, what happened to that guy? Oh, didn't you hear? He 'Varricked' himself because some girl 'Zhu Li'd' him!""",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Enough! What makes you think we would let you blow yourself up? You're working for Kuvira! You don't get to quit. [Gestures to the guards.] Grab him.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[As the guards advance on him, he pulls a detonator from his pocket.] You try to pull me away from this thing and I'll hit this remote, and blow it immediately!",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Why do you have a timer and a remote?,6,4,45
Varrick,"Well, first, I built the timer, but then I thought, you could drag me off the train, so then I built a remote, but then I thought, do I really need the timer, because now I got a remote in my-- [Interrupts himself.] Whatever! I'm covering all my bases! The point is, you're leaving, we're staying!",6,4,45
,"Cut back to Zaofu, where Korra is still losing the fight against Kuvira. She shoots fire, but Kuvira turns the ground under Korra's feet, so that she faces the other way. Korra recovers and bends a boulder at her opponent, but she bends a metal plate around Korra's ankle, somersaulting her through the air, falling down a few yards away.",6,4,45
Suyin,You have to go into the Avatar State! Do it!,6,4,45
,"Korra watches Kuvira lunge for her and suddenly goes into the Avatar State, stopping Kuvira and blasting her away with airbending. Kuvira gets up again, but Korra launches herself after the metalbender, blasting her even farther away. Kuvira's hair untangles in the process; Korra rises up from the ground on an air spout, taking an enormous boulder with her, preparing to crush Kuvira. Kuvira pulls herself to her hands and knees, slowly raising her head to face Korra; Korra sees herself in the Avatar State as opposed to Kuvira's face, the same way she hallucinated herself before. Shocked, Korra panics and falls out of the Avatar state, dropping the boulder as she falls helplessly to the ground. Quick cut to Opal and Jinora, looking on.",6,4,45
Jinora,I don't understand. We got the poison out; what's wrong with her?,6,4,45
Kuvira,I knew you were weak.,6,4,45
,"Kuvira shoots two plates at Korra and suspends her in mid-air by her wrists. The metalbender smiles, before slamming Korra into the ground and encasing all but her head in a mound of earth, trapping her. She walks closer and, taking six metal plates and bending them to give them a razor's edge, prepares to kill Korra. Jinora and Opal, seeing what is about to transpire, send simultaneous blasts of air at Kuvira; caught off guard, she flies through the air, landing hard on her back in front of her troops. Rising to her feet with the help of two of her soldiers, she angrily cries out at the airbenders.",6,4,45
Kuvira,You broke our agreement! [To her army.] Attack!,6,4,45
,The army charges forward and Jinora and Opal create a tornado to hold them back. Several soldiers are blown away and the rest are rendered unable to do anything but brace against the raging wind.,6,4,45
Jinora,"[Yelling over the wind to Opal.] Keep them back, I'm calling for help!",6,4,45
,"Cut to inside Zaofu, where Huan is watching how Ikki draws a colorful, childish portrait of herself. Meelo, to her left, is also painting.",6,4,45
Huan,"Stunning work, Ikki. It hurts my eyes with its ... raw, emotional power! [He walks over to where Meelo is painting and takes in his work. Cut to Meelo's painting, which is a lifelike depiction of himself in a nobleman's cloak.] Ugh, pedestrian. I already know what you look like on the outside, I want you to show me, the inner Meelo!",6,4,45
,Jinora's astral projection appears before them.,6,4,45
Jinora,Help! You have to get Korra and the rest of us out of here now! Hurry!,6,4,45
Meelo,[Kicks down his easel.] Finally! Let's get it on!,6,4,45
,"Cut back to the train, where Baatar Jr. and his men are evacuating Varrick's lab.",6,4,45
Bolin,"That's everyone, our half of the train is clear.",6,4,45
Varrick,"That's good, we're almost out of time.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[Glaring at Varrick.] You're insane.,6,4,45
Varrick,"[Triumphantly.] You knew that when you hired me! Bolin, do the thing! [Bolin hesitates, not knowing what Varrick means; angrily.] Unhook the cars, oh, come on, that was an easy one!",6,4,45
,"The cars are unhooked with a single pull of a lever, shutting the door of Varrick's lab, while the rest of the train pulls away from them.",6,4,45
Bolin,"Man, that was great! I gotta admit, you had me going there for a while, I really thought you were gonna blow us up! Now, how do we turn this thing off?",6,4,45
Varrick,"Ooh, we can't turn it off. We're gonna blow up-- [Bolin becomes horrified.] --but, we had a pretty good run, right?",6,4,45
Bolin,"[Grabs Varrick by the collar.] What are you talking about, ""a good run""? I'm still running! I like running!",6,4,45
,"He runs over to the machine, looking at it from various angles, but does not know what anything does. He looks around the car and sees a hatch in the floor. He runs over and opens it, sticks his head through, and sees that it leads down to the tracks.",6,4,45
Varrick,"[Poetic.] I'll see you on the other side, [Bolin stands up, glaring at Varrick.] Zhu Li.",6,4,45
Bolin,"[Slaps Varrick in the face and grabs him by the collar again.] I want you to know, [Points at him.] I hate you.",6,4,45
,They jump down the hatch and Bolin catches them with his earthbending. Baatar Jr. is looking through a spyglass at the train as it suddenly blows up in a bright purple flash.,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,I can't believe he actually blew himself up. That man was crazier than a sewer pipe elephant-rat. [Turns to his men again.] Let's get back to Zaofu.,6,4,45
,"Cut to the crater, where Bolin breaks through the wall, letting him and Varrick come out of a tunnel, coughing. Varrick starts laughing and lets out a victory roar.",6,4,45
Varrick,"Yes! [Bolin just looks at him angrily.] You did it, Bolin, you did the thing! [Kisses Bolin on the forehead.]",6,4,45
Bolin,I can't believe Zhu Li worked for you as long as she did.,6,4,45
,"Back at Zaofu, the tornado created by the airbenders is still going strong and even Kuvira's mecha tanks are struggling to move through the headwinds. Korra wakes up and breaks through the wall surrounding her, but she immediately falls to the ground.",6,4,45
Meelo,"[Far above them.] Dive, Pepper, dive! [Pepper dives into the midst of the tornado.] Here comes a hurricane! [The tornado dies down, Opal and Jinora grab Korra and launch themselves onto Pepper's back, while Meelo airbends at Kuvira's tanks.] You can't handle all this Meelo!",6,4,45
Jinora,"We've got her, go! [Pepper takes off.]",6,4,45
Opal,We have to save them!,6,4,45
,"Opal prepares to jumps off to get her mother and brothers, but she is stopped by Jinora and Ikki.",6,4,45
Suyin,"Opal, [Cut to a close-up of Suyin.] get out of here, we'll be fine! [Cut back to Opal.] Just go!",6,4,45
Opal,[Tearing up.] I'll be back for you! I love you!,6,4,45
Kuvira,"[Watches Pepper fly away and turns around to her troops, thrusting one arm into the air in victory with a smile.] Zaofu is ours! [Army cheers.]",6,4,45
,"Cut to inside Zaofu, where banners of the Earth Empire have been dropped down from high buildings.",6,4,45
Kuvira,"[Addressing the crowd.] Bring the citizens of Zaofu to kneel before the Great Uniter! All who pledge their loyalty to me will keep their freedom and will be dealt with fairly as full citizens of the Earth Empire. The rest will be imprisoned as traitors, like Su Beifong and her sons. Now bow!",6,4,45
,"The crowd kneels down before her, save for Baatar and Huan. Baatar Jr., furious, walks up to his father.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Bow to her! Do it! She is your rightful leader!,6,4,45
Baatar,"[Turns his head in shame.] I am so disappointed in you, Junior.",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,[To the guards.] Take them away! [Two guards take away Baatar and Huan.],6,4,45
Huan,Get your hands off me! You're crushing my individuality!,6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,All hail the Great Uniter!,6,4,45
,"The crowd cheers, as Suyin lets her head hang in disappointment. Cut to Suyin's garden, where Kuvira is playing with a piece of meteorite, contorting it into various shapes with one hand while talking to Baatar Jr..",6,4,45
Kuvira,"Are you sure, there's no way they survived?",6,4,45
Baatar Jr.,Positive. But I think I can replicate his work with the spirit vines and get us back on track. I'll just need an assistant.,6,4,45
,Kuvira looks over to Zhu Li and smiles.,6,4,45
Kuvira,How would you like to help Baatar build the most powerful weapon the world has ever seen?,6,4,45
Zhu Li,"It would be my honor, Great Uniter. [Walks away.]",6,4,45
Kuvira,"[To Baatar Jr., not looking at him.] Begin dismantling the domes.",6,4,45
,Roll credits.,6,4,45
,"The camera shows a zoomed up shot of Air Temple Island before sliding to the left and showing Pabu jumping out of his hiding place around a corner, running toward a snoozing Naga. Pabu playfully pounces on and bites Naga's tail; Naga ignores Pabu, not moving until an audible groan sounds from above them. Naga and Pabu look up to see Pepper descending toward the ground, Korra waving from the front of the saddle.",7,4,46
Korra,Naga!,7,4,46
,"Naga, wagging her tail, sprints off toward the courtyard; Pabu bites onto Naga's tail as she takes off running, and he streams out behind her as Naga runs. As Pepper lands, several other ring-tailed flying lemurs land on a nearby rooftop; Korra, jumping off Pepper, airbends herself herself to the ground, smiling before Naga lifts her off the ground. She licks Korra excitedly, before circling around behind her.",7,4,46
Korra,"[Hugging Naga's head.] I missed you so much, girl!",7,4,46
,Meelo and Ikki run past Korra and Naga.,7,4,46
Meelo,[Yelling.] Mom! Dad! We're back! And we got Korra!,7,4,46
,"As they run past, Bumi approaches from the right, Bum-Ju floating along behind him.",7,4,46
Bumi,"[To Korra.] Aren't you a sight for sore eyes! [Hugging Korra, lifting her off the ground.] Bum-Ju and I sure missed you.",7,4,46
Korra,"It's so great to see you again, Bumi. And you too, Bum-Ju.",7,4,46
,"As Bum-Ju whistles happily, the scene cuts to Meelo and Ikki, running up to Tenzin and Pema as they enter the courtyard.",7,4,46
Tenzin,"[To Ikki and Meelo.] Well done kids! [As Tenzin hugs Ikki, Pema hugs Meelo.] I'm proud of you all for finding Korra.",7,4,46
Meelo,"[Looking expectantly at his father, raising one eyebrow up and down.] Proud enough to get me my tats?",7,4,46
Tenzin,"[Flatly, turning away from Meelo.] No.",7,4,46
,"As Pema stifles a laugh with her hand, Tenzin walks over to Korra, giving her a hug.",7,4,46
Tenzin,Welcome home.,7,4,46
Korra,"I missed you, Tenzin.",7,4,46
,"As they separate, Opal walking up behind them, Tenzin speaks, more seriously.",7,4,46
Tenzin,"Now, I hate to get right down to business, but I want to hear what happened in Zaofu.",7,4,46
,"The happiness evaporates, and an awkward silence hangs over the group, punctuated only by Bum-Ju's twittering. Bumi finally speaks, seriousness mingled with sarcasm.",7,4,46
Bumi,Way to ruin the moment.,7,4,46
Opal,"Kuvira's whole army was there. She captured Mom, Dad, and my brothers.",7,4,46
Korra,[Downcast.] I thought I was strong enough to stop her. I feel like such a failure.,7,4,46
Tenzin,No one expected you to handle Kuvira on your own. It's up to all of us to find a way to deal with her. [Smiling again.] We're just glad to have you back.,7,4,46
Bumi,"Where's Bolin? He's not still on Kuvira's side, is he?",7,4,46
Opal,I can't believe he would stay with her after what she did to my family. But we don't know where he is.,7,4,46
,"Cut to a close-up of Bolin with unkempt hair, who is panting. The scene zooms out to reveal him carrying Varrick, who has unkempt hair and a stubble, on his back.",7,4,46
Bolin,How about you use your own legs for a while?,7,4,46
Varrick,"You know, when I fled Republic City with Zhu Li, she carried me twenty miles in one day. And that was after she sprained her ankle.",7,4,46
Bolin,"[Throws Varrick off his back.] Well, Zhu Li's not here, okay?",7,4,46
Varrick,"[Keeps lying on his back, waves his hand at Bolin.] That's fine, leave me here, let the worms gobble me up. I deserve it.",7,4,46
Bolin,"No way mister! You're not getting off that easily. You're responsible for that weapon Kuvira is trying to make. Which, may I remind you, could hurt a lot of people.",7,4,46
Varrick,"No, don't remind me! I know, I'm a horrible, horrible person!",7,4,46
Bolin,"[Calmer.] Okay, look. Kuvira fooled us both into doing her dirty work and I'm not happy about it either. But, you know how we're gonna make it up to the world? By getting back to Republic City and warning everyone what she's up to! So, I want you to take my hand [He holds out his hand to pull Varrick back on his feet.] and march with me out of this forest!",7,4,46
Varrick,"[Smiles and takes Bolin's hand.] You really have a way with words, kid. No wonder I made you a mover star. All right, I'll take the driver's seat for a while, hop on. [He bends over so that Bolin can climb on his back.]",7,4,46
Bolin,"Oh, great, my feet could use a break. [He jumps on Varrick back, who nearly collapses under the weight.]",7,4,46
Varrick,"[Grunts with the trouble.] Oh, boy, here we go! [He takes one step with great effort but they are soon trapped by a net, which hoists them up to a tree branch.]",7,4,46
Bolin,Are you kidding me?!,7,4,46
,"Cut to Republic City, where Asami is reading a magazine of Future Industries. She smiles when she sees Korra.",7,4,46
Korra,I hope you haven't been waiting long.,7,4,46
Asami,Only three years. [Gets up and hugs Korra.] It's so good to see you again.,7,4,46
Korra,You too.,7,4,46
Asami,And I'm loving the hair.,7,4,46
Korra,Thanks. [Blushes.] You're looking snazzy as always.,7,4,46
Asami,Come on. Mako got us a table at the restaurant.,7,4,46
,"They walk to the restaurant, where Mako is leaning against a booth.",7,4,46
Mako,Korra!,7,4,46
Korra,"Hi, Mako. [They give each other a hug.]",7,4,46
Wu,"[Interrupts them, to Mako's annoyance and Korra's surprise. Addresses Korra.] Hello there, Prince Wu, rightful heir to the throne and [Pokes Mako in the chest with his elbow.] this guy's boss. I bet he's told you a lot about me.",7,4,46
Korra,Nope. Not a thing.,7,4,46
Wu,"[Puts his arm around Korra's shoulder, much to her surprise.] Then we have so much to talk about. [He pushes Korra into the booth, sitting down next to her.] You are going to love the food here, I know the chef personally. [To a maître d.] Let's start with a round of your spicy octopus fritters [Maître d walks off.] and keep the cucumber-aloe water coming! [To Korra again.] Gotta keep this princely skin hydrated.",7,4,46
Asami,[She and Mako sit down opposite of Korra and Wu; annoyed to Mako.] I thought it was going to be the three of us.,7,4,46
Mako,"Sorry, but I couldn't ditch him. But he promised to be on his best behavior.",7,4,46
Wu,"[Leans in very close to Korra.] Hey, pop into the Avatar State for me. I want to see your eyes glow.",7,4,46
Korra,[Annoyed.] What? No! [Wu disappointedly sits back normally.],7,4,46
Asami,So can you go into the Avatar State again? I was worried when you told me you couldn't.,7,4,46
Mako,"Wait, when did she tell you she couldn't? [Nobody answers, while Wu keeps sucking on his drink.] What's going on with you two?",7,4,46
Korra,[Hesitant.] I wrote to Asami while I was away. I asked her not to tell you. I'm sorry.,7,4,46
Mako,"Well, why didn't you ever write to me? Or Bolin?",7,4,46
Korra,I don't know. I guess ... I didn't know what to say.,7,4,46
Mako,"[Sits back, crosses his arms in front of him.] ""Hello"" would have been nice.",7,4,46
Wu,"Mako, if it makes you feel any better, she didn't write me either.",7,4,46
Mako,[Angry.] Why would she ... [Sighs.] Never mind.,7,4,46
Korra,"I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch, but I'm back now. [More upbeat.] And I wanna know everything about what's been going on with you two.",7,4,46
Asami,"Well, I kind of have some big news. I went to visit my father for the first time. He had been writing me letters and I guess I finally felt ready to try and forgive him.",7,4,46
Korra,You sure you can trust him? He might just be manipulating you again.,7,4,46
Asami,[Angrily.] You think I don't know what my own father is capable of?,7,4,46
Korra,"[Apologetic.] No, I didn't mean ...",7,4,46
Asami,[Interrupts Korra.] You don't get to disappear for three years and then act like you know what's best for me!,7,4,46
Korra,"It's not like I planned to be gone for that long, I wanted to come back, but I never felt ready until now.",7,4,46
Wu,"As much as I'm enjoying this little catch-up, my royal bladder is about to explode. Mako, come on, I need you to stand guard.",7,4,46
Mako,"I'm not gonna hold your hand every time you have to empty your ""royal bladder"". Go to the bathroom on your own for once.",7,4,46
Wu,[Dejectedly.] Fine. [Walks off.],7,4,46
Korra,Do you always go to the bathroom with him?,7,4,46
Mako,"I don't go with him, with him, I just stand there in the general vicinity while he ... I don't wanna talk about it.",7,4,46
,"Wu walks into the bathroom, where an attendant is waiting.",7,4,46
Bathroom attendant,"Good afternoon, Sir. Perhaps a spritz of cologne, to freshen up?",7,4,46
Wu,"Make it a double, buddy!",7,4,46
,The attendant covers his mouth and nose with the towel he is holding and sprays Wu with a red vapor. Wu starts coughing heavily.,7,4,46
Wu,"[Faintly.] Mako, help! Wu ... down ... [Passes out.]",7,4,46
,"Cut to Bolin and Varrick who are trying to escape from the net, bu to no avail.",7,4,46
Bolin,I wish Pabu were here. He could just chew us out of this.,7,4,46
Varrick,You know who else has incisors sharp as a knife? Zhu Li ...,7,4,46
Ahnah,Well look what we caught. Wonder if they were tracking us after we escaped.,7,4,46
Bolin,Hello fellow travelers! I don't suppose you can help us out of this net?,7,4,46
Ahnah,Why would we free a couple of lowly Earth Empire soldiers?,7,4,46
Varrick,Lowly? We were part of Kuvira's inner circle!,7,4,46
Bolin,"Were, not anymore! Please, just, let us out!",7,4,46
Baraz,I know just what to do with a couple of Kuvira's top men.,7,4,46
,"Baraz firebends a dagger and cuts through the rope of the net with it. Cut back to Republic City, where food is being served at the table while Wu is not back yet.",7,4,46
Mako,I wonder what's taking Wu so long. He's not one to miss out on lunch. I'll go check on him.,7,4,46
,"Korra and Asami give each other a worried look, while Mako walks off.",7,4,46
Mako,"Wu, are you in here? Come on, your octopus fritters are getting cold.",7,4,46
,"Cut to Korra and Asami waiting outside, when Korra spots the bathroom attendant walking past with a cart full of laundry bags.",7,4,46
Korra,I'll be right back. [Walks after the bathroom attendant.],7,4,46
,"She walks out the back of the hotel, where the attendant is dumping the load of laundry into the back of a van.",7,4,46
Korra,"Excuse me, did you happen to see if Prince Wu came out this way?",7,4,46
Bathroom attendant,"Sorry miss, I haven't seen him.",7,4,46
,"The pile of laundry bags moves and Wu rolls out, semi-conscious.",7,4,46
Wu,"[Not fully aware.] Hmm, I'm in laundry ...",7,4,46
,"Korra gets an angry look on her face, but before she can do anything, the attendant bends the ground under her to launch her into the ceiling. He runs to the front of the van and, while his coworker slams the back doors shut, drives off. Mako and Asami run out to check on Korra.",7,4,46
Korra,"They've got Wu! Get the car, I'm going after them!",7,4,46
,"The van speeds out of the alley next to the hotel and Korra is not far behind. She launches a fissure its way, but the van jumps over and keep on driving. Asami pulls up next to her in a blue roadster.",7,4,46
Asami,Get in!,7,4,46
,Korra jumps in the car and Asami guns it. The van makes a sharp turn and the attendant bends up a wall to block them. Asami manages to steer clear of the wall just in the nick of time.,7,4,46
Korra,We're losing them!,7,4,46
Mako,Hang a right at the next block. We can cut them off on Seventh.,7,4,46
,Top down shot shows the roadster going straight on.,7,4,46
Mako,You missed the turn! Where are you going?!,7,4,46
Asami,I know these streets better than you. I built some of them!,7,4,46
,They drive up the elevated freeway and the van comes into view below them. Korra stands up.,7,4,46
Mako,What are you doing? Sit down!,7,4,46
,"Korra jumps off the car and onto the van, catching herself with airbending. She metalbends the roof open, only to find the van empty, save for the bathroom attendant.",7,4,46
Korra,Where is he?,7,4,46
,"She jumps in, pulls the guy from behind the wheel with airbending, and stamps on the brakes, skidding the van to a halt next to a couple of spirit vines. Korra pulls him out.",7,4,46
Korra,Wu's not here. This guy was the only one in the truck.,7,4,46
Mako,[Grabs the bathroom attendant by the collar and slams him into the van.] Where's the prince?,7,4,46
Bathroom attendant,Halfway to Kuvira by now. [Smiles.] All hail the Great Uniter.,7,4,46
Asami,They must have moved Wu to a different vehicle when we lost sight of them.,7,4,46
Mako,"[A police car pulls up next to them and Mako throws the now cuffed attendant in the back, before talking to the driver.] Take this guy in for booking. Charge him with kidnapping and tell Chief Beifong that Prince Wu is missing. Put out an all-points bulletin. We'll keep looking.",7,4,46
Asami,Where do we start? There are thousands of cars in the city and he could be in any one of them.,7,4,46
Mako,Or they might try smuggling him out on an airship.,7,4,46
Asami,Or maybe a boat.,7,4,46
Mako,He could be anywhere! [Grunts in frustration.] The one time I don't watch him pee and this is what happens.,7,4,46
Korra,"[She walks up to the spirit vines and puts her hand on it, feeling for Wu's energy. The energy flashes through the vines and she sees him driving up to the Central City Station.] They're taking Wu to the train station!",7,4,46
Asami,Are you sure? How do you know?,7,4,46
Korra,"[Jumps into the back of the car.] I'll explain on the way, just drive! We're running out of time!",7,4,46
,"Cut to Varrick and Bolin, whose hands are tied together, while Ahnah bends water into her pouch.",7,4,46
Bolin,So how did a bunch of water and firebenders end up in one of Kuvira's reeducation camps?,7,4,46
Ahnah,[Angrily.] Call it what it is: a prison.,7,4,46
Baraz,Kuvira's been purging states of anyone who's not of Earth Kingdom origin and locking them up.,7,4,46
Bolin,[Surprised.] Purging?!,7,4,46
Baraz,"What are you acting so surprised for? You must have known what she was up to, being part of her ""inner circle"" and all.",7,4,46
Bolin,"No, I swear! And the inner circle thing lasted like, less than a day!",7,4,46
Varrick,[Irritated.] Will you at least tell us where you're taking us?,7,4,46
Baraz,The border checkpoint. You're gonna help us talk our way past some Earth Empire soldiers.,7,4,46
Ahnah,"And once we're through, we'll see about letting you go.",7,4,46
,"Bolin and Varrick shoot each other a meaningful look, when Varrick jumps up as Bolin sends a wave of earth around, knocking everyone down. He quickly turns the ground in front of him into a pool of lava, holding everyone at bay.",7,4,46
Varrick,[Laughs.] Lava time! Bet you didn't expect that!,7,4,46
Bolin,"[Stands up again and snaps the ropes tying his hands, which were weakened by the lava.] Look, I'm sorry for what happened to all of you, but as I've been trying to explain, we don't work for Kuvira anymore.",7,4,46
Varrick,"Yeah. If our handsome mugs get recognized trying to go through that checkpoint, we're goners!",7,4,46
Baraz,"If you really are fugitives, you better listen up. We've been scouting this region for days. There's a wall stretching along the entire border and patrols guarding every part of it. That checkpoint is the only way out.",7,4,46
Ahnah,"It's not worth the risk, Baraz. How do we know they won't turn us in?",7,4,46
Baraz,"If he wanted us gone, we'd be at the bottom of a pool of lava right now. If any of us want to get out of the Earth Empire alive, we'll have to trust each other.",7,4,46
Bolin,"[Cools the lava so that it becomes solid again.] All right, where is this checkpoint?",7,4,46
,"Cut back to Republic City, where Asami is high-tailing it on their way to the train station.",7,4,46
Mako,"[To Korra.] So, how do you know where Wu is just by touching some spirit vines?",7,4,46
Korra,I learned how to connect to people's energies through them.,7,4,46
Asami,Who taught you that?,7,4,46
Korra,"Lin's mom. [Mako and Asami both look surprised.] I found her in the swamp, that place is like one giant spirit wild.",7,4,46
Asami,You met Toph? What was she like?,7,4,46
Korra,"A cranky, more miserable version of Lin.",7,4,46
Mako,Is that even possible?,7,4,46
Korra,You'd be surprised.,7,4,46
,"They arrive at the train station, where they get out of the car. Asami slips on a modified version of the chi blocking glove as they make their way inside. They arrive on a bridge over the platforms and see many trains parked.",7,4,46
Mako,Which train is Wu on?,7,4,46
Korra,I don't know!,7,4,46
Mako,Split up and start looking.,7,4,46
,"Cut back to the Earth Empire, where Bolin, Varrick, and the prisoners approach the heavily guarded gate. Bolin and Varrick have made themselves look somewhat respectable again and the prisoners are tied together with rope around their wrists.",7,4,46
Bolin,[Whispers.] Follow my lead.,7,4,46
Guard post soldier,"[Salutes Bolin.] Good afternoon, sir. Can we help you?",7,4,46
Bolin,You sure can. We captured these escaped prisoners. We need to get them to a secure facility.,7,4,46
Guard post soldier,Where did they escape from?,7,4,46
Bolin,Camp fourteen.,7,4,46
Guard post soldier,Then why are you bringing them through here? Camp fourteen is the other way.,7,4,46
Bolin,[Aggravated.] You think we don't know where Camp fourteen is? Kuvira wants them transferred.,7,4,46
Guard post soldier,Then I'll need to see the transfer order.,7,4,46
,Bolin gives Varrick a worried look and Varrick moves up to the guard.,7,4,46
Varrick,"Listen pal! I had to fight off two badgermoles, six wolfbats and eighteen hog monkeys to capture these guys, so sorry if I don't have the paperwork! I was too busy cramming it in a hog monkey's mouth, while it was trying to eat me! I am in sore need of a shower and I have blisters that are the size of cantaloupes and twice as juicy! So you can let us through, or you can give us your name and rank and I'll make sure to pass it on to Kuvira! You know what happens to soldiers who question her orders, don't you? Bad stuff!",7,4,46
Guard post soldier,[Nervous from Varrick's little display.] Let them through!,7,4,46
,"Two guards metalbend the gates on either side of the wall down and they walk through. Inside the wall, there is a guard working in a booth, where there are wanted posters of Varrick and Bolin. He recognizes them as Varrick waves to him and runs out to stop them.",7,4,46
Guard #2,"Wait! Stop them, they're traitors to the Empire!",7,4,46
,"They all start running, but are halted by two mecha tanks that jump down from the top of the gate and land in front of Bolin and Varrick. They find themselves surrounded by four mecha tanks and four earthbenders.",7,4,46
Baraz,There's no way I'm going back to prison!,7,4,46
,"He makes a little dagger from his middle fingers, cutting through the rope on his wrist, and shoots fire at the soldiers, who throw up cover for themselves. They shoot the rocks back at the prisoners, who defend themselves with their fire and waterbending. Bolin and Varrick are under attack by a mecha tank, which attempts to mow them down with its flamethrower. Bolin throws up cover for them, but Varrick still crawls away. Baraz is fighting a mecha tank as well, dodging its punches. Ahnah comes to his aid and bends her water into a slab of ice, causing the running tank to slide. Baraz blow it back with a few fire blasts, but the tank uses the spikes in its calves to stabilize and break the through ice. It shoots lightning, forcing Baraz and Ahnah apart, before shooting its flamethrower at Baraz, who holds his own with his firebending. Bolin shoots a few boulders at two mecha tanks going after him, which yields no result. So he creates a pool of lava, but the tanks jump over it, cornering Bolin. Varrick, who is hiding underneath the gate, behind a wall, sees how a waterbender is knocked down. He and spots some sort of generator inside the booth. With a screwdriver he unscrews a table leg and wraps a length of electrical wire around it. Bolin is still fighting the tank, but it continues to nimbly dodge the lava benders attacks. Finally, with a fissure, he manages to knock one of the tanks down, but another one is right there to shoot a bolt of lightning at him. He launches himself out of its path and continues the fight. Meanwhile, Varrick has created an electromagnetic pulse, which he hooks up to the generator. Nobody pays him any attention, seeing how they are busy fighting off the benders. Bolin get trapped by three mecha tanks who all shoot fire at him, which he blocks with a wall of earth, but he is unable to escape.",7,4,46
Varrick,"[Hooks up the cables.] Boy, I sure hope this works.",7,4,46
,"He pushes a lever and the stick sends out an electromagnetic pulse, destroying all the electronics in the mecha tanks, causing them to fail, just as they were about to kill Bolin and Baraz. It takes everyone by surprise.",7,4,46
Varrick,"[Laughs, pleased with himself.] I still got that Varrick touch! [Runs out, past Bolin.] We're clear, come on!",7,4,46
Bolin,"[Bolin sees how the prisoners are fighting a losing battle.] Varrick, wait, we can't leave them!",7,4,46
,"He jumps over his wall and runs up behind the prisoners, just as one is knocked down. Bolin creates a massive pool of lava, forcing the guards back to the gate.",7,4,46
Guard post soldier,Retreat!,7,4,46
,"Bolin bends the lava all the way to the gate and hoses the wall with it, securing the knowledge the guard will not follow them.",7,4,46
Baraz,Thanks. You didn't have to come back.,7,4,46
Bolin,Yeah. I kind of did. Let's go!,7,4,46
,"The scene shifts back to the train station, where people are standing around in conversation.",7,4,46
Over the PA,The 4:15 bound for Omashu is now leaving on track number six. All aboard!,7,4,46
,Mako is frantically searching for Prince Wu. The scene changes over to Korra's search. Asami walks over to her.,7,4,46
Asami,"[Worried.] If we don't find Wu soon, we might never find him.",7,4,46
,Korra leans down and places her palm on the floor of the train station. The area around her hand glows yellow as she feels for Wu's energy.,7,4,46
Korra,[She raises her head and turns to look at a nearby train. She runs toward it.] He's on that train!,7,4,46
,"Korra, Asami, and Mako barely manage to jump on the train as it speeds away. They enter a train car with a few passengers sitting at tables against the walls of the car.",7,4,46
Mako,How do you know for sure he's here?,7,4,46
Korra,"I don't. But I had a feeling, okay?",7,4,46
Mako,"And I'm just supposed to trust your ""Avatar Feelings""?",7,4,46
Korra,[Korra faces Mako and stops walking; annoyed.] You wouldn't have to if you had guarded the prince like you were supposed to.,7,4,46
,Korra and Mako storm out of sight. Two passengers from opposite sides of the car glance over to each other looking ready. Asami opens the door to the next train car. The three enter a cabin sprinkled with luggage.,7,4,46
Mako,"[Angrily.] Oh, so it's my fault Wu disappeared.",7,4,46
Korra,It's certainly not mine!,7,4,46
,A red chest rattles behind Asami.,7,4,46
Asami,"Guys, shh. Listen.",7,4,46
,"Their attention is brought to the red chest after it rattles again. Mako walks up and bends down. He opens the lid and Prince Wu pops up, shouting and flailing.",7,4,46
Mako,"[He grabs the distraught Wu.] Wu! Wu, it's me.",7,4,46
Wu,[Confused.] Mako? Where am I? Am I dead?,7,4,46
Mako,"No, you're on a train. We're gonna get you out of here.",7,4,46
,"The train car door is opened by the passengers who had shared a look earlier. The man fires metal bands at Korra, but she easily deflects them. In turn, she creates a tornado of air and sends it flying at the pair of attackers. It causes them to hit the ceiling and fall to the ground. More attackers come running from the train car in front and in the back. Korra metalbends the front door shut, blocking an attacker. She rips apart the ceiling, exposing a cloudy blue sky.",7,4,46
Korra,Everyone out.,7,4,46
Wu,I'm not going up there.,7,4,46
,"Korra sticks out her lip, annoyed by Wu's unwillingness to cooperate. Cut to an exterior shot of the train as Wu flies out of the open roof, being lifted by an air blast. He lands on the roof of another train car with Korra, Mako, and Asami following right behind him. The group runs to the end of the train. Asami and Korra make it over fine, but Mako has to pass Wu over to Korra before finally getting over himself. Two more attackers bust through the door and see the prince getting away. They shoot metal cables to the roof, flinging themselves up to Korra, Asami, Mako, and Wu. Mako attempts to get rid of them, but is tripped by a metal cable shot to his foot. The attacker shoots a cable at Korra, who wraps it around her arm. Even more attackers arrive on the roof. Asami quickly defends herself by kicking an attacker's punch out of the way and shocking him with her glove, flinging him back. Another assailant adjacent from Asami begins to metalbend the roof, curling it in on Asami. On the opposite side of the train car, Mako kicks up from the ground and at the same sends fire from his foot, which forces the attacker that had Korra's arm, back. Mako punches at him and the attacker does a backhand spring onto the train car behind him. He metalbends the roof up, too, just like on the other side. Mako steps backward as his footing is being taken away. Mako, Wu, Asami, and Korra all move in together as the roof is being peeled up. Korra bends a sphere of air around the group, grabbing Asami and Wu.",7,4,46
Korra,Jump!,7,4,46
,"They leap from the train just in time to avoid being crushed. They all scream as they hurdle toward the ground in the air shell. The shell hits the ground to the side of a bridge. The team grunts as they roll to a stop on the dusty ground. The train continues its pace toward the Earth Empire. Asami and Mako stand up, while Korra and Wu remain sitting on the ground. Mako walks over and picks up Wu.",7,4,46
Mako,You all right?,7,4,46
Wu,"[He gleefully embraces Mako.] Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Putting his arm around Mako.] You are definitely getting a raise, Buddy.",7,4,46
Mako,You should be thanking Korra. We never would have found you with out her.,7,4,46
Wu,"[He moves over to Korra and bows.] I owe you my life, Avatar. If only there was some way to repay you. Oh, I know. [He takes Korra's hand.] How about I take you out for a night on the town?",7,4,46
Korra,[Unimpressed.] Really? You're asking me out right now?,7,4,46
Wu,"[Tentatively.] So ... I put you down for a ""maybe""? [He cracks a smile.]",7,4,46
Korra,How about a never?,7,4,46
,Korra takes her hand back from Wu and walks over to Asami and Mako.,7,4,46
Korra,Not exactly what I imagined for our first day back together.,7,4,46
Asami,But it was kind of like old times. [She puts her hand on her hip.] Except for the getting on each other's nerves part.,7,4,46
Mako,"Actually, that is like old times for me and Korra.",7,4,46
Korra,I'm sorry things got so tense earlier.,7,4,46
Asami,"It's all right. I guess after being apart for three years, there's bound to be a bit of an adjustment period.",7,4,46
Mako,"Yeah, but it's great to have you back.",7,4,46
Korra,There's no place else I'd rather be.,7,4,46
,"The three hug each other and Wu walks over ready to join in, too. However, Korra sticks her hand out and holds the prince at bay with a hand to his cheek. Unable to come closer, Wu places his hands on Mako's shoulders, while the three friends share a close embrace.",7,4,46
Wu,You guys are the greatest friends a guy could have.,7,4,46
,"They break apart into a circle again, this time Wu is included.",7,4,46
Korra,"So, what are we gonna do with him? It's too dangerous to take him back to the hotel.",7,4,46
Wu,Whoo! You're telling me! I need a cushy safe house somewhere.,7,4,46
Mako,I think I know just the place.,7,4,46
,"The camera displays an elaborate estate; a dazzling landscape with several courtyards, gardens, towers, and lots of space. The camera zooms in to Mako, Asami, Korra, and Wu on the front porch of the mansion. Gigantic windows litter the façade, allowing plenty of light into the mansion.",7,4,46
Wu,"[Astonished.] Nice digs, Mako. You didn't tell me you came from money.",7,4,46
Mako,I don't. This is Asami's place. She was nice enough to let my family stay here after they fled Ba Sing Se.,7,4,46
,"The big wooden door opens and Mako's grandmother, Yin, steps onto the porch.",7,4,46
Yin,Mako! It's so wonderful to-- [Her eyes go big and she covers her mouth as she gasps at the sight of the prince. She reaches out for Wu with her left hand.] Are you ...,7,4,46
Mako,"Grandma, this is Prince Wu. He needs to stay with you and the family for a little while.",7,4,46
,Wu takes one knee and grabs Yin's hand.,7,4,46
Wu,"It's an honor, Grandma Mako.",7,4,46
,"Wu kisses Yin's hand and she faints gracefully, being caught by Mako.",7,4,46
Mako,She loves royalty.,7,4,46
Wu,"[He stands up triumphantly.] I think I'll fit right in here. [Touching Mako's shoulder.] Thanks for looking out for me, Mako. [He throws his arms back urgently.] Now where's the nearest bathroom? I have been holding it all day! [He storms off into the house, whining loudly.]",7,4,46
,"The scene changes to a bay area surrounded by open water and rocks. The setting sun is making the sky a orange. Next to a long dock is a beat up looking red and white, wooden boat with several escaped reeducation campers aboard. The boat is in poor shape. On the dock, Baraz and Ahnah are facing Varrick and Bolin.",7,4,46
Bolin,"I know it might not mean much coming from a guy wearing this uniform, [He tugs at his shirt, near his belt.] but I'd like to apologize for what Kuvira's put you through.",7,4,46
Baraz,[Extending his hand.] I appreciate that.,7,4,46
,Bolin shakes his hand.,7,4,46
Bolin,Guess this is where we part ways.,7,4,46
Varrick,[Laughing.] It's been a blast!,7,4,46
Ahnah,We're heading north too. Why don't you come with us? It's the least we could do after you saved our necks.,7,4,46
Varrick,"[He looks over to rotting boat, barely floating in the water next to the dock.] On that hunk of junk? No thanks. I'm allergic to drowning. [Bolin glares at him and elbows him harshly.] I mean, uh, we'd love a lift!",7,4,46
,"Defeated, Varrick walks up the pier with the other three. Bolin jumps in and Varrick crawls in awkwardly causing great commotion, ultimately falling to the floor of the boat. The scene shifts again to the roots of a tree. Someone's hand is hammering in a small stake with a cord attached to it. A green remote with various nobs is taken out. A gauge with a red needle makes a noise and the needle flies right into the reddest area of the gauge. Baatar Jr. is kneeling with the gauge in his hand. Kuvira is standing behind him anticipating the news.",7,4,46
Baatar Jr.,This area is overrun with spirit vines. [He turns to Kuvira.] And they appear to be even more powerful than the samples we took from Republic City.,7,4,46
Kuvira,Perfect. Harvest the vines until there's nothing left.,7,4,46
,A mecha tank retracts it hand and replaces it with a chainsaw that deploys from its wrist and begins cutting through a tree root. The camera zooms out to show the banyan-grove tree in the Foggy Swamp. Several of Kuvira's army airships are floating around the tree.,7,4,46
,Roll credits.,7,4,46
,"As the title card fades, the shot shows a slow zoom on the Sato estate before cutting to its interior, specifically the pool room. In a small room which opens onto the pool itself stand Wu and Mako, dressed in training gear.",8,4,47
Wu,"You know, there's something about being kidnapped that makes a guy realize he needs to get his act together.",8,4,47
Mako,"Yeah, I agree. Let's toughen you up.",8,4,47
,"Wu raises his hands in a defensive manner as Mako moves in closer; he throws a punch, which hits the prince in the chest. He falls to the ground immediately.",8,4,47
Wu,"[Yelling.] Daaah, I wasn't ready! [Gets in a fetal position.] Wu down!",8,4,47
,"As Mako looks down at Wu, a shocked gasp from behind him causes him to turn his head; Yin and Tu stand behind him, appraising the situation.",8,4,47
Yin,"What's going on? [She walks to Wu and holds him.] Mako, how dare you injure the prince! Would his royal highness like a cherry-berry lemonade?",8,4,47
Wu,"And maybe some of those sticky dumplings, too?",8,4,47
Mako,"[Angrily.] Look at you! You're so weak, ""Wu down"" is your catchphrase.",8,4,47
Wu,"I know, I'm a wimp. But it's not my fault, I was born that way! I'm not like you Mako, I wasn't raised by a pack of cops in the woods.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Annoyed.] You don't know anything about me, do you?",8,4,47
Wu,"[Tiny pause.] Yeah, I'm drawing a blank. Why is that? How do I not know stuff about you?",8,4,47
Mako,Uhh ... you never asked?,8,4,47
Wu,"Well, I'm asking now! [Grasping Mako's shoulders.] What's your favorite food? What's your favorite color? Is there a special lady in your life?",8,4,47
Mako,Not since Korra and I broke up.,8,4,47
Wu,[Amazed.] What? You dated the Avatar? [Points to the floor.] Sit! [Lets go of Mako and rubs his hands together.] You and I need to have a little gab session right now! [They sit facing each other.] How'd you guys first meet?,8,4,47
,"As Mako tells his story, the scenes change to the events to which he refers. As people, including Mako, interrupt the tale, white circles containing the head of the speaker appear in the corners of the scene, stylized in a chibi-like fashion. This format is consistently adhered to throughout the episode. At this point, the scene fades to Bolin and Mako, competing in the Pro-bending Arena in the past.",8,4,47
Mako,Bolin and I were playing for the Fire Ferrets.,8,4,47
Wu,"[Interrupting, his head popping up in the top left; smiling excitedly.] You were a pro-bender?",8,4,47
Mako,"[Annoyed, his head popping up in top right as the scene continues. Sighs.] Yes. Will you just let me tell the story?",8,4,47
Wu,[Closes his eyes.] Carry on.,8,4,47
,Their heads disappear and Mako promptly continues.,8,4,47
Mako,"Bolin and I grew up dirt poor, so once I became a pro-bender, I wanted it all: Riches; fame; accolades. But all that changed when I met Korra.",8,4,47
,"With a flash, the scene transitions into the flashback where Bolin introduces Korra to Mako.",8,4,47
Bolin,"Come on, I want you to meet my brother, Mako.",8,4,47
Korra,"Mako? Wow, I-I heard you play on the radio!",8,4,47
Mako,"Come on, Bolin, we're up.",8,4,47
Wu,"[Head in top right.] Whoa! That was the first time you met? Kind of rude there, buddy!",8,4,47
Mako,"[Head in lower left corner.] You know what else is rude? Interrupting. [The heads disappear as the scene shows Korra winning her first pro-bending match by knockout.] Korra proved to be an amazing pro-bender [Cut to the Equalists kidnapping Bolin.] and a loyal friend. She helped me save Bolin when he was taken by the Equalists. [Cut to Korra knocking out the lieutenant, before switching to Korra and Mako sleeping against Naga in the park.] After going through such a crazy experience, I felt like Korra and I had a powerful connection.",8,4,47
Wu,"[As Mako and Korra stir, realizing that they are leaning on each other.] So then you smooched her real good, eh?",8,4,47
Mako,[As they scramble away from each other.] Not exactly.,8,4,47
,Cut to Mako running across the street into the path of Asami's moped.,8,4,47
Mako,Ahhhh!,8,4,47
,"She hits him, throwing him backward. As he lands in a heap in the street, Asami dismounts and rushes over to him.",8,4,47
Asami Sato,"Oh no! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you!",8,4,47
Mako,"How could you not see me? I mean I was ju-juuuu [Asami takes off her helmet and lets her hair down.] I was, I-I, wow. [Coughs.] That was ... [Clears his throat as Asami helps him up; the frame freezes.]",8,4,47
Wu,[Top right.] Wait. That was the first thing you said to Asami? You really gotta work on your introductions.,8,4,47
Mako,"[Lower left, looking cool.] Hey. When you got charm like mine, you don't need introductions.",8,4,47
,The heads disappear as the shot flash-transitions to Mako and Asami at dinner.,8,4,47
Mako,Hanging out with Asami was awesome. But it made things with Korra [Cut to the end of the playoff match as Mako and Korra walk to their lockers.] complicated.,8,4,47
Korra,"So, I was thinking we should spend some time together. [Rushing in close to Mako.] Look, I really like you and I think we were meant for each other. [She reels back in embarrassment, hiding her face.]",8,4,47
Mako,"Korra, I'm really sorry, but I just don't feel the same way about you. [As Korra turns to look at him, the shot shows his face; he looks tense and apprehensive.]",8,4,47
Wu,"That's harsh, Mako.",8,4,47
Mako,"I know. [Cut to Asami kissing Mako on the cheek; he looks almost sad as Korra glances sadly back at him.] And the worst part about it is, it wasn't totally true.",8,4,47
,"Cut to the balcony, where Mako walks up behind Korra.",8,4,47
Mako,We need to talk.,8,4,47
Korra,Save your breath. You've already made it clear how you feel about me.,8,4,47
Mako,"No, I haven't. What I'm trying to say is, as much as you drive me crazy, I also think you're pretty amazing. [Korra kisses Mako, who initially seems shocked but relents. Freeze frame as interruptions come from all sides.]",8,4,47
Wu,"[Appears lower right; elated.] Hot dog! Smooch City, here we come. You player.",8,4,47
Tu,"[Appears upper right, slurping a drink; widens his eyes in surprise.] Whoa. I thought you were dating Asami.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Appears upper left, irked.] Tu! Get out of here!",8,4,47
Yin,"[Appears lower left, glares up at Mako while berating him.] Naughty Mako! You take after your grandfather!",8,4,47
Mako,"Guys, Grandma, everything wasn't so cut and dry. I wasn't dating Asami.",8,4,47
Tu,"[Rolling his eyes, his voice singsong.] Denial.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Giving up.] Okaaay, maybe I was dating her; it was all very confusing.",8,4,47
,"The frame reanimates, the heads disappear, and the scene flash-cuts to a semi-conscious Korra being helped off Naga's back by Mako, he takes her in his arms.",8,4,47
Mako,But my feelings for Korra became clear when Tarrlok captured her. It felt like a piece of me was gone.,8,4,47
Mako,[To Korra.] I was so worried. Are you all right?,8,4,47
Korra,I'm fine. I'm glad you're here.,8,4,47
,"Cut to Asami, who looks dismayed.",8,4,47
Wu,"Hoo! I bet Asami wasn't too happy about that. [Cut to the scene in the kitchen, Asami washing dishes while Mako stands by.]",8,4,47
Asami,"I've noticed how you treat Korra, how you acted when she was missing. You have feelings for her, don't you?",8,4,47
Mako,Things are crazy right now. Can we deal with our relationship problems later?,8,4,47
Asami,"Well, there might not be a relationship to worry about later.",8,4,47
Mako,[As she walks away.] Asami!,8,4,47
,"As he puts his head down and sighs, the frame freezes again.",8,4,47
Wu,[Appears top left.] Ouch!,8,4,47
Mako,"[Appears lower right, saddened.] Yep. Turns out, she was right. It was time to man up and call it quits.",8,4,47
,The scene flash-cuts to Asami and Mako standing in the sewer; Asami faces away from him.,8,4,47
Mako,"Asami. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. But whatever happens today, I want you to know how much I care about you.",8,4,47
Asami,"I care about you, too.",8,4,47
,She kisses him on the cheek and the frame again freezes abruptly.,8,4,47
Wu,[Appears upper left; eyes half open; confused and unconvinced.] Wait. Was that supposed to be you breaking up with her?,8,4,47
Mako,[Appears lower right; blankly.] Yes. That was a breakup.,8,4,47
Tu,[Appears lower left; unconvinced.] Didn't sound like a breakup.,8,4,47
Mako,"[Widen his eyes slightly; explaining.] It was mutual. We had an understanding! [Looks to the side.] We both knew— [He cuts off frustrated, biting his tongue and closing his eyes in the form of an x as he changes the subject. His face returns to normal; wide eyes; annoyed.] Can I just get on with the rest of my story or what?",8,4,47
Wu,Fine. [Mako lowers his eyelids.] But I hope you weren't as ambiguous with Korra as you were with Asami.,8,4,47
Mako,"Trust me, I wasn't.",8,4,47
,Cut to the South Pole after Amon's defeat; Mako catches up to Korra as she walks away from the healing house without her bending.,8,4,47
Mako,"Korra and I ended up stopping Amon together and after that, I was finally able to tell her how I felt. Exactly how I felt.",8,4,47
Mako,"I love you, Korra.",8,4,47
,"Flash-cut to Korra as she leaves the Avatar State, finding Mako standing behind her. She runs to him and they embrace.",8,4,47
Korra,"I love you, too.",8,4,47
,They kiss and the frame freezes. Yin and Mako both pop up at the same time.,8,4,47
Yin,[Lower left.] Awww. And then you two lived happily ever after?,8,4,47
Mako,"[Lower right, not looking at Yin.] Ummmm ...",8,4,47
,"Cut to Korra and Mako, alone on the ship, as the heads vanish.",8,4,47
Mako,Tenzin's just trying to help you become the best Avatar you can be.,8,4,47
Korra,Of course you take his side.,8,4,47
Mako,I'm not taking his side.,8,4,47
,"Flash-cut to the two on Naga's back, traveling toward the spirit portal.",8,4,47
Korra,"You know, sometimes I wonder whose side you're on.",8,4,47
Mako,There aren't any sides!,8,4,47
,Flash-cut to Mako and Bolin's apartment.,8,4,47
Korra,How could you take his side?,8,4,47
Mako,What's with you and sides?,8,4,47
,Flash-cut to a few moments later.,8,4,47
Korra,"[Chuckles sarcastically.] Well, excuse me, officer! Don't let me stand in the way of you writing tickets! I'm just trying to save the world!",8,4,47
,Flash-cut to the police station.,8,4,47
Mako,"Well, I guess if we're both putting our jobs first, maybe there's no room for our relationship!",8,4,47
Korra,"So, what? Are you ... breaking up with me?",8,4,47
Mako,Yeah ... I guess I am.,8,4,47
,"As Korra kicks Mako's desk with airbending, the shot freezes and Wu pops in.",8,4,47
Wu,[Lower right.] Now that's a breakup!,8,4,47
,Flash-cut to the ship being attacked by bombs.,8,4,47
Mako,"After that, I dove into my work. Someone had been taking out supply ships heading to the Southern Water Tribe. [Cut to Mako and Asami on the ship they used as bait.] Asami's company was one of the victims, so she and I worked together to catch the perps. [The Triple Threat Triad members corner them and Mako lashes out with fire.] The stakeout was the perfect way to get my mind off Korra. It was an intense night. [Mako and Asami escape in a lifeboat.] Asami and I discovered the triads had double-crossed us. We barely got away, but by then, Asami's warehouse had been cleared out.",8,4,47
,"Cut to the city and the warehouse, empty but for Asami and Mako.",8,4,47
Asami,My company ... it's over ... I give up.,8,4,47
Mako,Well ... I'm not giving up on you.,8,4,47
,"They look into each other's eyes before she kisses him. The frame freezes, Mako and Wu popping up at the same time.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Lower right, as Wu gives him a look with a smile.] I know, I know, don't tell me ... I had no right kissing Asami.",8,4,47
Wu,"[Lower left.] No, actually, I'm completely fine with that. You officially broke up with Korra and therefore, you're free to smooch whoever you wish.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Downcast, not meeting Wu's eyes.] If only it had been that simple.",8,4,47
,"Cut to the prison after Mako's release. As Asami looks at him, Korra suddenly runs to him, embracing and kissing him, to his shock.",8,4,47
Korra,"Mako, I missed you so much!",8,4,47
,Mako seems to miss the disparaging look Asami is giving him.,8,4,47
Mako,"Korra ... hey, I-I missed you, too. [Hesitant.] So you're not still mad at me? We had that fight before you left, remember?",8,4,47
Korra,Not really. I got attacked by a dark spirit and I lost my memory for a little while. Maybe it hasn't all come back yet. Was it a bad fight?,8,4,47
Mako,"Ahhhhh ... [The shot pans, showing the other people all watching him.] Hmmmm, no. No. It-it wasn't that bad.",8,4,47
,Freeze frame as Mako and Wu pop up again.,8,4,47
Wu,"[Top center.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were back with Asami, but then Korra came back and thought you guys were still together and you didn't tell her you weren't?",8,4,47
Yin,"[Popping up lower center, glaring at Mako.] Just like your grandfather.",8,4,47
Mako,"[Lower right.] Well, me and Asami were never officially back together.",8,4,47
Tu,"[Top right, over Mako, staring down at him.] Really? That again? You know, it seems like you're so afraid to disappoint anyone that you end up disappointing everyone.",8,4,47
Wu,[Solemnly.] Truer words have never been spoken. [Mako bites his tongue again. Wu's eyes widen while smiling.] High-five! [Wu and Tu high-five.],8,4,47
Mako,"Well, eventually, I did tell Korra. But by then, she already knew.",8,4,47
,Cut to the palace in the Southern Water Tribe after Unalaq's defeat.,8,4,47
Korra,Why didn't you just tell me the truth in the first place?,8,4,47
Mako,"I know I should have, but ... I didn't want to hurt you all over again. I guess part of me wanted to forget about the breakup, too.",8,4,47
Korra,I think we both know that this ... us ... doesn't work.,8,4,47
Mako,You're right.,8,4,47
Korra,It's ... over. For real this time.,8,4,47
,"Mako nods and the scene flash-cuts to a wide shot of the palace, panning up to the spirits in the sky.",8,4,47
Mako,"After Harmonic Convergence, the world changed. Team Avatar traveled around, searching for new airbenders. At first, it was awkward being around Korra and Asami.",8,4,47
,"The scene flash-cuts again, this time to Mako standing in front of Korra and Asami in the square.",8,4,47
Mako,[Overly serious.] As you were. [He salutes.] Ladies.,8,4,47
,"He turns, still holding his salute, and walks away, leaving them to glance wonderingly at each other. The scene cuts to Korra talking to Mako near the airship, trying to convince him to go with them. He turns and walks away from her.",8,4,47
Mako,But then I realized I had to figure out who I was without a lady in my life.,8,4,47
Wu,I know what that's like.,8,4,47
,The scene flash-cuts back to the Sato estate and the room by the pool. Wu stretches before elaborating.,8,4,47
Wu,"I mean, to need distance from women. [Laughing a bit.] Because I have so many, all over me, all the time.",8,4,47
Mako,"[After a brief pause.] Anyway, [Flash-cut to Mako's battle with Ming-Hua.] I eventually helped Korra defeat Zaheer and save the airbenders. [Cut to Korra hugging Mako; he smiles slightly.] And we did it as friends. Korra showed me the importance of putting others before myself [Cut to Korra in the Tree of Time, followed by Korra walking out of the blizzard at the Southern Spirit Portal, and finally to Korra returning to the Avatar State for the first time after Amon.] and whenever I think of her, she continues to inspire me.",8,4,47
,Flash-cut to the pool room. Wu stands up.,8,4,47
Wu,Wow! That story is amazing and I really learned something!,8,4,47
Mako,You did? Good. [Standing as well.],8,4,47
Wu,"Yeah! I learned that I really didn't know anything about you! Crazy! [More seriously.] Also, I realized that ladies are complicated. No offense, Grandma.",8,4,47
Yin,None taken.,8,4,47
Wu,"I better just focus on being a better king. [Getting back in a battle stance.] Okay, come at me. I can take it.",8,4,47
,Mako's first punch knocks Wu to the ground again.,8,4,47
Wu,Aahhhhh! Wu down!,8,4,47
,"As Mako stares at the prince, Yin, upset, slaps his arm harshly.",8,4,47
,"Fade to Air Temple Island, where Korra is staring out over the sea at sunset in the meditation pavilion. Asami walks up to her.",8,4,47
Asami,I brought you some tea. [Korra looks up surprised.] I thought you might be cold out here.,8,4,47
Korra,You're so sweet. [She takes the cup from Asami.] Thanks. [Turns back to stare out over the sea.],8,4,47
Asami,Are you okay? You seem out of sorts.,8,4,47
Korra,Sorry. I've just been thinking about something Toph said. She told me that the world doesn't need me and it's basically pointless to try and stop Kuvira.,8,4,47
Asami,That's ridiculous.,8,4,47
Korra,"At the time, I thought so, too. I figured she was just being her normal, cranky self. But I'm beginning to think she had a point.",8,4,47
Asami,"No, she doesn't. The world does need you. You're the Avatar.",8,4,47
Korra,"But no matter what I do, the world seems to always be out of balance! [Cut to a flashback of her firebending training from ""Welcome to Republic City"".] Growing up, I couldn't wait to be the Avatar. I thought I was really gonna change things. I was so naive. [Cut to a clip from ""The Revelation"", when Amon takes the bending of Lightning Bolt Zolt.] The first time I saw Amon take someone's bending away, I was terrified.",8,4,47
Amon,Your firebending is gone! Forever.,8,4,47
Korra,"[Cut to a clip from ""Endgame"", when Amon takes Korra's bending.] Then my worst nightmare came true.",8,4,47
Mako,Korra!,8,4,47
Korra,[Panicking.] No!,8,4,47
,Amon proceeds to take her bending away and she falls over.,8,4,47
Amon,I told you I would destroy you.,8,4,47
Asami,"[Cut to Amon revealing himself as a waterbender to the public.] Korra, you're forgetting about all the good that happened after you exposed Amon as the fraud he was. The Equalist Movement lost its leader and its power. [Cut to a clip from ""Rebel Spirit"" which shows Raiko and his wife waving at the crowd.] Free elections were held in the United Republic and nonbenders finally had a voice. [Cut to a clip from ""Peacekeepers"" when Korra shakes hands with Raiko.] People had hope again and it was all because of you.",8,4,47
Korra,"And I was hopeful, too. That feeling didn't last long. [Cut to a clip from ""A New Spiritual Age"", when Unalaq reveals he has captured Jinora; voice-over.] As soon as I defeated Amon, a new enemy took his place. [Unalaq threatens to corrupt Jinora's spirit; in the flashback.] I can't believe I trusted you. You made me think you wanted to restore balance with the spirits, but this, this isn't balance, it's madness! Now let her go!",8,4,47
Unalaq,"If you want your friend to make it out of the Spirit World, you'll open the other portal now.",8,4,47
Korra,"[Back to narrating.] Because of Unalaq, I betrayed Tenzin, opened the portals, and threw the Spirit and human worlds into chaos. [Cut a clip from ""Harmonic Convergence, when Vaatu escapes.] It was my fault he fused with Vaatu and became a Dark Avatar. [Cut to Unalaq ripping Raava out of Korra and destroying the spirit.] And I was helpless to stop him from destroying Raava and cutting off my connection to my past lives. [Cut to clip from ""Darkness Falls"" when the past Avatars are being destroyed.] With Raava gone, Unalaq and Vaatu became more powerful than ever. [Cut to a clip from ""Light in the Dark"" where UnaVaatu shoots down Lin's airship.]",8,4,47
Asami,"[Cut to Korra's energy form emerging from the Tree of Time.] But you became more powerful, too. I mean ... you turned into a giant spirit.",8,4,47
Korra,Yeah ... that was pretty awesome.,8,4,47
Asami,"[Cut to a clip from ""The Southern Lights"" when Korra opens the Southern portal.] And opening the spirit portals turned out to be a good thing. [Cut to subsequent clips from ""Original Airbenders"" and ""Venom of the Red Lotus"", showing the airbenders standing together and Jinora's master ceremony, respectively.] You brought back the airbenders and caused a positive shift in the world.",8,4,47
Korra,"Yes, [Cut to a clip from ""Enter the Void, showing Zaheer flying with Korra over his shoulder.] but Zaheer got airbending too and nearly killed me. [Cut to them fighting and Zaheer suffocating Korra.] If it weren't for Zaheer, [Cut to a clip from ""Long Live the Queen"", when Zaheer kills Hou-Ting.] the Earth Queen would still be alive. There would have been no crisis in the Earth Kingdom [Cut to a clip from ""After All These Years"", where Kuvira smiles after forcing the bandits' subjugation.] and Kuvira wouldn't be in power. [Cut to clips from ""Enemy at the Gates"" when Kuvira's army arrives at Zaofu.] Things are more out of balance than ever now. Nothing's changed!",8,4,47
,"Cut back to real time, showing that Tenzin has walked up to the two girls.",8,4,47
Tenzin,"You're right, Korra.",8,4,47
Korra,I am?,8,4,47
Asami,She is?,8,4,47
Tenzin,"It's true, there will always be new conflicts and enemies to face. But the important thing is to learn from your enemies and better yourself over time, which you have. [Cut to clip from ""A Leaf in the Wind"", where Korra destroys the airbending gates.] You've changed so much since you first arrived on Air Temple Island. When you first came here, you were hot-headed and a bit selfish. [Cut to a clip from ""A Breath of Fresh Air"", when Korra tries to talk Daw down off the bridge.] But you've matured into a thoughtful young woman who puts the needs of others before herself. [Cut to a clip of Jinora's master ceremony from ""Venom of the Red Lotus"".] The new Air Nation is a testament to that. You sacrificed everything to save them. You're an inspiration to the world.",8,4,47
Korra,"[Back in real time.] Thank you both. I know this Kuvira problem is only going to get worse. But no matter what happens, no matter how crazy things get, I'll always try to restore balance. [Pan to the setting sun. Fade to black.]",8,4,47
Baraz,"[Fade to the refugees' ship.] And that's when I made a solemn vow never to eat bark-onion soup again. [Cut to Baraz telling a story with a bored Ahnah in the background.] Been six years, four months and fourteen days ... [Closes his eyes and shudders in disgust.] Urgh! [Opens his eyes.] I can still taste it. [Cut to the bored refugees in a circle laying down and sleeping with Bolin with his head on his hands and Varrick lying casually.]",8,4,47
Bolin,[Raises up and talks to everyone; extremely bored.] Does anyone else feel like throwing themselves overboard?,8,4,47
Varrick,"[Raises up, widens his eyes, and points to himself with his thumbs.] Not me! [The refugees widen their eyes in surprise, slightly sit up, and turn their attention to Varrick, who sits up.] I've spent the last few hours tuning out all these incredibly boring stories ...",8,4,47
Baraz,[Slightly moves; offended.] Hey!,8,4,47
Varrick,"[Ignoring Baraz's insulted exclamation and preparing to stand up.] All the while [Stands up and dramatically points his finger to the air.] mentally composing the most exciting tale [Lowers his head to Bolin.] ever told, soon to become the greatest [Leaping enthusiastically into the center of the ring of bored refugees.] mover [Spreads his arms out.] ever made! [Cut to a close-up of Varrick.] I present to you now: [Makes a screen with his arms smiling on a wondering Bolin.] Bolin, [Cut to a shot of the title screen of The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South.] as Nuktuk, Hero of the South— [A chibi head of Varrick appears lower right with a serious look on his face and eyelids half open.] Trademark Varrimovers International— [Brightens up with wide eyes and a smile.] in [The frame switches to several scenes from ""Night of a Thousand Stars"", one in which Bolin tears of his sleeves before fighting the assassins.] the incredible true story of Bolin! Hero of the world!",8,4,47
Bolin,"[Another view of him waving to the ecstatic crowd after he defeats them; confused.] Wait, am I playing Nuktuk, or is Nuktuk playing me?",8,4,47
Varrick,"[As the view cuts back to Varrick, looking at Bolin and holding up his hands, framing him in an imaginary shot.] Both. It's your true story, but we'll capitalize on the [Stops making the screen and looks to Bolin with a smile.] audience of the Nuktuk franchise. [Sags down with an annoyed look as if it is obvious.] Duh!",8,4,47
Bolin,"[Cut to a close-up of Bolin; guilty.] How can you call me ""the hero of the world""? [Looks down.] I left my friends and family to join up with a psychotic dictator who imprisoned me and now, [Looks away in shame.] I'm running back home with my tail between my legs.",8,4,47
Varrick,"Nyahbabababab! You're emphasizing the wrong story beads. Let me tell it. The story of Bolin begins in an exotic port of call. [Cut to a view of the Southern Water Tribe.] A wise sage, the richest merchant in the world, and a handsome devil all [Cut to a shot of Varrick's yacht in port.] sit on a single pillow in the living room of a luxury yacht! How do they all fit on one pillow?",8,4,47
Bolin,"[As the shot changes to Varrick sitting on his pillow, trying to levitate.] Ooh! Giant pillow!",8,4,47
Varrick,"Wrong! They're all the same man! Me! [Cut to the swami in ""Rebel Spirit"" who looks up to Varrick.] I try to teach a swami the power of levitation, but he's too stupid [The swami glares.] to understand it, so I kick him out. [The swami bows his head and retreats up the steps behind Varrick.] ""Upon whom can I bestow my awesome knowledge?"" I ask myself. Then, in walks Nuktuk, with a twinkle in his eye, a gorgeous dame on his arm, and a song on his lips. He bursts into a rapturous melody! [Singing.] ""Where can I find my teacher?"" [Cut back to Varrick who has his left hand out and his other on his chest as he sings.]",8,4,47
Bolin,"Oh, come on! I wasn't singing, you were not levitating, and Asami is just a friend, thank you very much. [Varrick appears slightly hurt and pouts. The camera slowly zooms in on Bolin, who looks up with a wistful smile.] If you want to tell my true story, you should start from when I met Korra. She came to the bending arena, one fateful night ...",8,4,47
,"Flashback to the events of ""A Leaf in the Wind"", as Bolin, meeting Korra for the first time, shows her the pro-bending arena.",8,4,47
Korra,This place is even more amazing than I imagined!,8,4,47
Bolin,"Name's Bolin, by the way.",8,4,47
Korra,Korra. [The scene freezes.],8,4,47
Baraz,[Interrupting; voice-over.] Bo-ring! [Scene cuts back to the present with the circle of refugees.] When does the singing start?,8,4,47
Bolin,[Irritated.] There wasn't any singing!,8,4,47
,"All the refugees break into a chorus of boos at the same time, some even giving Bolin a thumbs-down sign much to his surprise.",8,4,47
Varrick,"You're on-screen talent, kid. Leave the storytelling to the masters. [Flash-cut to the scene from ""A New Spiritual Age"" in which Korra and Jinora are swallowed by a massive reptilian spirit.] So, the trouble begins when the Avatar is trapped in the Spirit World. The world's most evil villains realize that with Korra out of the way, the time is right to try to take out Bolin. [Cut to a shot of Bolin as Nuktuk in one of the movers, followed by another mover shot of the villains' hideout.] So, the worst of the worst team up. They're led by ... Zaheer, leader of the Red Lotus and master of the skies, a flying chaotic chaos machine! [Zaheer's montage is comprised of shots of him battling Korra in ""Venom of the Red Lotus"".] He's joined by ... Vaatu, the ultimate force of pure spirit evil in the universe. The biggest, meanest, scariest kite that ever flew! [Vaatu's montage is comprised of shots from ""Harmonic Convergence"" and ""Darkness Falls"".]",8,4,47
Bolin,"[Scenes of Vaatu avoiding Korra's elemental attacks from ""Darkness Falls"" plays on screen.] Wait! Zaheer didn't team up with Vaatu. How would that even happen?",8,4,47
Varrick,[As if it was obvious.] How do you think?,8,4,47
,"Cut to a shot of the Tree of Time; in the background, the ringing of a telephone can be heard. The shot cuts to Vaatu, imprisoned within the tree. He holds the mouth- and earpieces of a candlestick telephone up to the places where his mouth and ears should be.",8,4,47
Vaatu,Hello?,8,4,47
Zaheer,Hey. It's Zaheer.,8,4,47
Vaatu,"Oh. Hey, Zaheer.",8,4,47
,"The shot splits into halves as a separate shot of Zaheer, speaking on the other end of the line from the communication room at the Northern Air Temple from ""Enter the Void"", expands to occupy the right half of the screen.",8,4,47
Zaheer,[Suppressing a laugh with a half-smile.] Glad I caught you at home. [Slightly chuckles.],8,4,47
Vaatu,[Unamused.] Uh-huh. Very funny. Like I can leave this stupid tree.,8,4,47
Zaheer,"Hold on, let me conference in—",8,4,47
,"Cut to a level view of the stage as Amon emerges from a trapdoor in the stage with a line of Equalists behind him under loud approving cheers of the crowd. A spotlight is turned on, illuminating the Equalist leader, and the camera zooms in to a close-up.",8,4,47
Varrick,"Amon! The reanimated [Cut to a close-up of Amon.] zombie body [Cut to Amon bloodbending Korra and Mako.] of the bloodbending leader of the Equalists! [Amon's montage consists of his introduction in ""The Revelation"" and him bloodbending Korra and Mako in ""Endgame"".]",8,4,47
Amon,"[A shot of him on the phone slides in from the left of the shot, dividing the view into thirds.] Hey, guys, I'm totally in for taking out Bolin. He's way too powerful and awesome. But can we please not include—",8,4,47
,"A shot of Unalaq, as Varrick portrayed him in the black and white mover, slides into the frame from the left.",8,4,47
Unalaq,"Not include who, Amon?",8,4,47
Varrick,"[Narrating again.] The evil Unalaq. The diabolical but incredibly boring and unpopular sorcerer from the north, who's listening in on the other line!",8,4,47
Unalaq,"[Close-up.] I've spent my life trying to defeat Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, and I know just where to find him: With all the beautiful ladies!",8,4,47
,"Scene cuts to a montage of Bolin being kissed by Ginger in ""Night of a Thousand Stars"" and by Eska in ""Darkness Falls"".",8,4,47
Varrick,"Yes, Bolin had a reputation as the world's greatest ladies' man.",8,4,47
Bolin,"Oooh, now the story's getting interesting.",8,4,47
Varrick,"After leaving the beautiful but emotionally unstable Water Tribe princess at the altar, [Various shots of Bolin and Eska from ""Rebel Spirit"" and ""Civil Wars, Part 2"".] he met a fetching airbender, the heir to a vast Earth Kingdom fortune! [Several shots of Bolin and Opal, mainly from ""The Metal Clan"".]",8,4,47
Bolin,"[As a chibi-head with blushed red cheeks, in the lower right as shots of Opal continue. Longingly and gushing.] Opal, so smart and caring, so pretty to smell, [Bursting into tears, his ramblings becoming more high-pitched.] and she'll probably never talk to me again because I'm so stupid! Stupid! So, so, so [Nearly a whisper.] stupid. [As he bawls, the scenes in which she rejects him from ""After All These Years"".]",8,4,47
Varrick,"[His own chibi-head popping up in the lower left, irked.] Pull it together, you leaky lug. [Cut back to the boat where Bolin silently cries in the corner with a refugee close to him watch him. Dramatically.] But the darkest moment is always right before the dawn! For at his lowest point, Bolin sought advice from the man who started it all, the wisest of the wise—Me!—for some of my signature sage advice! [Cut to a shot of Varrick on a dock with Bolin, followed by the scene in ""Peacekeepers"" where Varrick hangs inverted, brainstorming. The scene is voiced-over by his own narration.] Nuktuk, I mean, Bolin, there's only one thing for you to do if you want to save the Avatar and defeat the ""Fearsome Foursome"" [The scene freezes as Varrick's chibi head pops up in the lower right. Thinking.] —I'm not really sure if I like ""Fearsome"", I mean, ""Evil Squared"" might be better. Whatever— You have to assemble the fighting-est airbender army of all time! But it turns out the airbender recruits are a sorry lot, [Cut to the obstacle course training sequence from ""Original Airbenders"".] so Bolin brings them to a secret mountaintop training facility, where he teaches them the ancient art of dodging fruit and balancing on sticks! Meanwhile, back with Zombie Amon ...",8,4,47
,"Cut to the conference call; Unalaq's image has vanished from the frame, leaving just Amon, Vaatu, and Zaheer.",8,4,47
Amon,"Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.",8,4,47
Unalaq,"[His image sliding back into view; unamused.] Haha, very funny, I'm still on the line. So, about that evil plan to destroy Nuktuk.",8,4,47
,"One by one, Zaheer, Vaatu, and Amon all slide out of the frame to the right, leaving Unalaq by himself in the frame.",8,4,47
Unalaq,[After a brief pause.] Hello? Anyone there? [Insistent.] Guys!,8,4,47
,"The off-hook tone sounds from Unalaq's phone. Cut to a scene from ""The Metal Clan"", in which Bolin is trying to flirt with Opal.",8,4,47
Varrick,"And with danger closing in, Opal realizes how much she loves Bolin and forgives him for whatever stuff he was talking about earlier, which will probably not be in the final cut of the mover anyway.",8,4,47
Bolin,[As the scene switches to show Bolin and Opal standing in the metalbending courtyard; hopeful.] She does?,8,4,47
All refugees,Awww!,8,4,47
Varrick,"And she kisses Bolin, magically passing on the airbender power of flight!",8,4,47
,"Cut back to the boat, where Varrick stands posing as if he is a bird, his hand on his head to imitate plumage and his lips pursed in the kiss he mentioned.",8,4,47
Bolin,"Okay, that part seems a little unbelievable.",8,4,47
Varrick,"[On a roll, not dissuaded.] This is no time for thinking, kid! We're heading into the big finale! [Another clip from ""Original Airbenders"", a panning shot of the airbenders themselves.] Bolin gathers his airbender army to fight alongside Rotan and Juji against the Terror Square! [His chibi head in the upper right as a clip from a mover plays; enthusiastically.] Maybe that's the name of the bad guys, ""Terror Square""! [More pensive.] What about ""Legion of Darkness""? Well, we'll put a focus group on it. [Back to the plot once again.] Bolin teaches the airbenders to create a giant tornado. [As the clip of the tornado from ""Venom of the Red Lotus"" plays.] Then he flies around in the sky, [Mover clip of Bolin in the clutches of the giant bird.] pushes Zaheer into it, [Another clip from ""Venom of the Red Lotus"", showing Zaheer being pulled down into the tornado as he tries to escape with Korra.] turning him into wind, forever! But Bolin doesn't realize that the Universal Interplanetary Combination Zero-Hour—talk about a ticking clock—is almost upon him! [Clip of the planetary alignment during Harmonic Convergence seen from space from the episode ""Harmonic Convergence"".] And when Juji shoots his laser eyes at the evil Unalaq, [Mover clip.] the beams accidentally fly into the magic spirit doorway! [Clip from ""Harmonic Convergence"", in which the electric beams of energy jump from the arcing spirit portals to the Tree of Time.] They bounce off Vaatu, setting him free, [Clip of Vaatu's release.] and hit Bolin, turning him into a giant! [Shot of Korra's giant blue spirit and Bolin's head raising itself upright.] But when Vaatu is set free, the evil Unalaq, who has always been an annoyingly clingy person, is so close to Vaatu that they combine into one horrifying monster! [Clip from ""Darkness Falls"" in which Unalaq and Vaatu combine.] Giant Bolin and the evil UnaVaatu fight toe-to-toe, zapping each other with their laser beams as they stomp around Republic City! [Clip from ""Light in the Dark"" in which Korra and UnaVaatu do battle in the harbor.] It looks like the evil UnaVaatu might win! [UnaVaatu raises the giant Korra spirit, on the verge of corrupting it.] But thankfully, Bolin's spiritual mojo is so strong that he attracts the queen of the fairies! [The orb of light floats downward and in between giant spirit Korra and UnaVaatu, revealing Jinora with butterfly wings.] With her help, Bolin turns UnaVaatu into magic dust and sprays him into the sky. [Spirit Korra cleanses UnaVaatu and little flecks of cleansed spirit float upward into the air. Varrick is speaking almost in a revered tone.] And that's where the stars come from. [Clip from ""A New Spiritual Age"" in which the dragon spirit soars down toward Korra, nearly corrupted, and picks her up; Varrick's last sentence is rushed and mumbled.] Oh yeah, and he turns into a dragon and he goes into the Spirit World and he saves the Avatar. [Enthusiastically.] The end!",8,4,47
,"Flash-cut back to the boat as Varrick finishes his tale. After a moment, all the refugees rise to their feet, happily applauding Varrick's story. Bolin also rises to his feet.",8,4,47
Bolin,"[Incredulous.] Wait! You like that? [As the applause dies.] It didn't make any sense! What about Zombie Amon? What happened to him, huh? And-and-and-and stars are magic fairy dust? [Walking over to Baraz, clutching the front of his ragged shirt.] Are you guys crazy? [Turning his head to look at Ahnah.] Are you crazy?",8,4,47
Baraz,[Calmly.] It's just a mover. [Bolin lets go of him.] Don't over-think it. It's like a ride.,8,4,47
Varrick,"[Suddenly jumping up behind Bolin and putting an arm around his shoulder.] Never let the truth get in the way of a good story, kid! [Bolin is not amused.]",8,4,47
,Cut to credits.,8,4,47
,"The scene opens to the camera panning down from the tops of the buildings of Republic City to the entrance of the Spirit Wilds, where a small crowd has gathered.",9,4,48
Ryu,"Everyone! Mom! Can we stay together, please? The tour is about to begin.",9,4,48
Ryu's mother,"That's my boy. Ryu, he used to live in the basement, but then he got airbending, and he's been doing important Air Nation stuff all over the world. [Laughs.] His father and I are here, visiting him and, we're just having the best time in the big city, we're so proud. Right, honey?",9,4,48
Ryu's father,"Well, at least he has a job now.",9,4,48
Ryu,"[Shaking his mother's hand off his shoulder.] Mom, Dad, I'm trying to work!",9,4,48
,"The scene shifts to within the Spirit Wilds, where Ryu is reading his cue cards.",9,4,48
Ryu,"[Addressing the small crowd, none of which are looking at him except his mother.] Fun fact, everyone. All these vines were created by UnaVaatu when he battled giant spirit Korra for the fate of the world.",9,4,48
Tourist #1,"[Turning to talk to Ryu.] Excuse me, are we in the Spirit World right now?",9,4,48
Ryu,[Sighing.] No.,9,4,48
Tourist #1,"[Taking pictures of the ground, not looking at Ryu.] Is the Spirit World in the ground below us?",9,4,48
Ryu,[Getting irritated.] No! Can I just get through my cards?,9,4,48
Ryu's mother,"[Walking over to him.] Aw, honey, don't get flustered.",9,4,48
Ryu,[More irritated.] I'm not!,9,4,48
Tourist #1,"Uhh, why is that vine coming toward us?",9,4,48
,"The view switches to behind them, looking down the street; a single vine is moving, creeping along the ground like a snake.",9,4,48
Ryu,"[As the tourists' cameras start flashing, he flips frantically through his cards.] Uh ... I don't see anything about that in the cards.",9,4,48
Tourist #1,[Snatching up a stick from the ground and running toward the vine.] I'm gonna poke it with a stick.,9,4,48
Ryu,No! Why would you do that?,9,4,48
,"The photographer pokes the spirit vine with a stick. After a brief pause, it smacks the stick out of the photographer's hand and wraps around him, raising him high into the air. Ryu races toward the vine and its captive.",9,4,48
Ryu,Everyone back!,9,4,48
Ryu's mother,This tour is exciting!,9,4,48
,"Flipping around his own axis, Ryu sends a blade of air at the vine, attempting to cut it, though to no avail. As Ryu's mother looks on in affection at him, everyone behind her is taken captive by more spirit vines.",9,4,48
Ryu's mother,[Unaware.] Isn't Ryu the best airbender ever?,9,4,48
,"As she turns to face the other tourists, a vine wraps around her ankle, lifting her also into the air as she screams. Ryu, turning to see his mother trapped, is attacked and wrapped up by a vine as well. As Ryu and the first captured tourist disappear from the frame, the latter drops his camera, which plummets to the ground, where the lens cracks and the body breaks. The scene shifts to Air Temple Island. Korra sits on the steps of a building, earthbending the stone of the courtyard; the view switches to Korra's side of the courtyard as Naga chases after each bit of earth that pops up. In the background, Opal can be seen walking down a short flight of stairs on the opposite side of the courtyard from Korra. As Opal approaches her, Korra sees her, the smile vanishing from her face, and stops earthbending. The airbender looks dejected.",9,4,48
Korra,Everything okay?,9,4,48
Opal,No. Kuvira has my family and no one seems to care but me.,9,4,48
Korra,"[Puts a hand on Opal's shoulder.] We all care. Don't worry, we'll get them back safely.",9,4,48
,Jinora comes flying in with her wingsuit and lands next to Korra and Opal.,9,4,48
Jinora,"Guys, there you are! I just felt a weird surge of spiritual energy coming from the Spirit Wilds. Something's wrong.",9,4,48
,"As looks of concern cross Korra and Opal's faces, the scene cuts to the three girls walking around the spirit wilds in the city.",9,4,48
Opal,Are you sure you felt a disturbance? Maybe you just had some bad food for breakfast.,9,4,48
Jinora,"[Above and behind Opal, looking through an empty window.] I'm telling you, I felt it. Maybe something happened to Ryu's tour group. We should've run into them by now.",9,4,48
Korra,"Yeah, but it's Ryu. They might be at the mall, for all we know.",9,4,48
Jinora,"Korra, can't you feel how strange the energy is?",9,4,48
Korra,No ... but maybe I can get a reading.,9,4,48
,"Closing her eyes, she puts her right hand on the vine she is standing next to. The vegetation beneath her hand glows and through the vine, she sees Kuvira's army covering the banyan-grove tree in the Foggy Swamp, cutting it into pieces. One of the vines, when cut, lashes out at the mecha tank working on it and wraps it up. Another suit shoots cables onto the vine, restricting the vegetation in order to save to other mecha tank, saving it. Other suites cut through the roots of the tree with chainsaw extensions on heir arms. In shock, Korra pulls back her hand from the root.",9,4,48
Opal,"[Startled.] Korra, what is it? Are you okay?",9,4,48
Korra,"It was Kuvira. I saw her taking vines from the swamp. It must be affecting our Spirit Wilds. I bet that's what you were sensing, Jinora.",9,4,48
Jinora,Why is she taking vines?,9,4,48
Korra,"Whatever the reason, I'm sure it's not good.",9,4,48
Opal,We have to tell Raiko. This might help him convince the other leaders to finally take her down!,9,4,48
Jinora,I'll keep looking for Ryu and the others.,9,4,48
,"Korra and Opal run off together to City Hall, while Jinora runs in the other direction, deeper into the wilds. Cut to an outside view of City Hall.",9,4,48
Raiko,[Voice-over.] I say we deal with this Kuvira situation immediately.,9,4,48
Wu,"[Cut to inside the building, where Raiko, Tenzin, Izumi, and Wu are sitting at the same table, with Lin standing next to Tenzin; excited.] Yes! Agreed! And I know just how to get rid of her: we tell her she won an all-expense paid vacation to a tropical island. Then, when she gets there, we reveal that it was a trap. The island's a prison! Boom! Got her! [Tenzin raises an eyebrow in disapproval. Wu backtracks when he sees Tenzin's reaction.] Or, okay, uh, I'm just spitballing here. We march in with an army of highly trained badgermoles! [He gets more disapproving looks from Raiko and Izumi. With a small voice.] Do we know if Kuvira has any allergies?",9,4,48
Raiko,"Look, I think we all know what must be done. We take the fight to her.",9,4,48
Tenzin,"[While stroking his beard.] I don't believe attacking is the right move, since she hasn't done anything aggressive toward the United Republic.",9,4,48
Lin,Not yet. But Kuvira can't be trusted. She told us that she was going to turn over power and she didn't. I'm with Raiko. I say we go on the offensive and start by retaking Zaofu.,9,4,48
,Korra and Opal barge into the meeting.,9,4,48
Korra,"President Raiko, I'm sorry to interrupt, but ... [Sees the meeting going on; surprised.] What's going on here?",9,4,48
Wu,"[Leans nonchalantly back over his chair; casually.] Oh, hey, Avatar Korra. Just kickin' it world leader-style, trying to figure out what to do about Kuvira. For the record, I told Raiko he should've invited you.",9,4,48
,"Camera pans right to Raiko looking at Wu. Raiko's eyes turn to the right to Korra. Cut to Korra, Mako, and Opal.",9,4,48
Korra,"[Annoyed.] You invited him, [Gestures to Wu.] but not me?",9,4,48
Tenzin,"Please, Korra, it's not personal. We just thought, perhaps we called you back into action a little too soon.",9,4,48
Korra,"Again, him, not me?!",9,4,48
Raiko,"[Stands up angrily.] Korra, we're in the middle of a meeting and we can't have people just barge in whenever they want!",9,4,48
,Bolin and Varrick barge in.,9,4,48
Bolin,"Guys! [Raiko's eyes widen and narrow with annoyance and anger.] Oh, [Cut to Bolin and Varrick running.] perfect! You're all here.",9,4,48
,"Bolin momentarily bends over, panting in exhaustion, though when he erects himself, he gives a small wave and grin to all those present. Cut to a shot of Korra, Mako, and Opal, who look on in surprise.",9,4,48
Opal and Mako,[Synchronized.] Bolin? [Korra grins.],9,4,48
Raiko,"[Even more angry.] What are you doing here?! Guards, remove these traitors!",9,4,48
Bolin,[The guards seize him and Varrick.] No! We escaped Kuvira's army! [Turns to the council.] We're back on your side now! [Cut to a close-up of Bolin; yelling.] We have top secret information for you!,9,4,48
,"Shot pans across a serious Tenzin, a surprised Wu, and a thinking Raiko. Raiko nods. Cut to a shot of the guards who let Bolin and Varrick go.",9,4,48
Varrick,"[Dusting himself off.] Okay, I guess we should've opened with that line.",9,4,48
Bolin,"Listen to me. Kuvira's making this thing that goes [Proceeds to make various explosion noises and yelling sounds.] I don't know how it works, but it has this [More strange noises.]",9,4,48
Varrick,"[Steps forward; irritatingly.] It's a super weapon! Like a regular weapon, only super.",9,4,48
Korra,[Cut to Korra. Mako and Opal's eyes go from Korra to Varrick as they talk.] And let me guess: it has something to do with spirit vines.,9,4,48
Varrick,[Surprised.] Yes! How did you know?,9,4,48
Korra,I saw a vision of her taking spirit vines from the swamp.,9,4,48
Varrick,"If she figures out how to harness their power, we are all doomed.",9,4,48
Raiko,[Worried.] She might use the weapon to attack Republic City. The only way to protect ourselves is with a preemptive strike.,9,4,48
Tenzin,[Raises his voice.] My airbenders won't be part of an unprovoked attack!,9,4,48
Izumi,Neither will the Fire Nation. [Cut to a medium close-up of Izumi.],9,4,48
Raiko,"[Cut to a wide side-shot of the council with Varrick and Bolin in the background.] But, Fire Lord Izumi, Kuvira is a threat to the world! She has to be stopped!",9,4,48
Izumi,"[Cut back to the close-up.] The Fire Nation has spent too much of its history [Closes her eyes.] fighting nonsense wars. [Opens her eyes.] And I refuse to drag my nation into another one [Narrows her eyes.] unless there is no other choice. [Cut back to the side-shot.] If you attack Kuvira, you'll do it without my army.",9,4,48
Raiko,Fine. I'll hold off any plans of attack. We'll go on the defensive and fortify security on the borders.,9,4,48
Izumi,"In that, [Softens her expression.] you'll have my help.",9,4,48
,"Cut to the exit of the building, where Opal walks out. Bolin catches up with her.",9,4,48
Bolin,"Opal, wait! Please, [Goes in front of her. Cut to a side-shot; remorsefully.] I just want to say that I'm sorry for everything.",9,4,48
Opal,"[Crosses her arms in front of her chest and closes her eyes.] I'm glad you're okay, but it's a little late for ""sorry"".",9,4,48
Bolin,"I know, I know. [Cut to a shot of Bolin. Looks to the side.] I didn't listen to you, and I [Looks down with a raised eyebrow.] sided with Kuvira, and I helped her take over the Earth Kingdom, and topple your home, and get your [Cut to a medium close-up of a displeased Opal.] mom captured, and [Opal raises her eyebrow.] your brothers, and your dad ... [He sees Opal's displeased expression. Cut back to the shot of Bolin.] Wow, that does sound really bad when I say it out loud like that. But I'm gonna make it up to you.",9,4,48
Lin,"Pardon me, lovebirds, but I need a word with Opal. [Lin gestures to the side and Opal walks in that direction. Bolin follows her, but Lin raises her hand to stop him.] Privately. [Alone with Opal.] I'm sorry, kid, but Raiko couldn't convince the other leaders to attack Kuvira.",9,4,48
Opal,So our family ...,9,4,48
Lin,Looks like we're going to have to save them ourselves.,9,4,48
Opal,Don't you think some other people would agree to go with us?,9,4,48
Lin,"This is an unsanctioned and dangerous mission into enemy territory. We can't ask other people to risk their necks for our family. If we want to break them out, we'll have to do it alone.",9,4,48
,"Pan to Bolin, who is still waiting by the exit. Mako and Korra walk up to him.",9,4,48
Mako,"Bolin, I'm so glad you're back. I was worried about you.",9,4,48
Korra,We all were. [They give Bolin a hug.],9,4,48
Bolin,"Thanks, guys. Mako, I'm so sorry about the way we left things. I'm such an idiot. You tried to warn me about Kuvira and I ran off anyway, like an idiot. You were right and I'm just an idiot. I hope ... that ... I'll be able to earn your trust again.",9,4,48
Korra,"If anyone has lost people's trust, it's me. Ever since Kuvira kicked my butt, no one even wants me around.",9,4,48
Mako,"[Puts a reassuring hand on Korra's shoulder.] We want you around. [Turns to Bolin; equally reassuring.] And Bolin, you're not an idiot. You were just doing what you thought was right.",9,4,48
Bolin,"Aww, I love you guys. And I really wanna hug again. [Proceeds to do just that.]",9,4,48
,"Cut back to the Spirit Wilds where Jinora is walking, still on the lookout for Ryu and his tour group. She finds the broken camera that was dropped by one of the tourists, though before she can continue her investigation, she finds herself attacked by a spirit vine. Right before it grabs her, she blasts herself onto a roof and dodges another vine attacking her. She jumps down again, flying away with her wingsuit, while evading more vines as they try to grab her. She cannot outrun them, however, and ends up captured as well. While the vines constrict her, she closes her eyes and focuses. Cut to an aerial shot of the square in from on City Hall where Mako and Korra are talking to each other. Jinora's spirit projection appears in front of them.",9,4,48
Jinora,Korra! The vines! They're taking me! Help!,9,4,48
,The projection vanishes again. Korra and Mako give each other a worried look. Fade to the entrance of the spirit wilds.,9,4,48
Lin,Get everyone out of here. Put up a perimeter. Cancel all tours. Somebody get a hold of Tenzin.,9,4,48
Korra,[She and Mako run up to the scene.] We gotta get in there and find Jinora.,9,4,48
Lin,I don't think anyone should be going in there right now.,9,4,48
Korra,"I know I'm not the old Avatar I used to be, but I can do this.",9,4,48
,"A vine suddenly emerges from the wilds, narrowly missing Lin, Korra, and Mako.",9,4,48
Lin,[To Korra.] Be careful.,9,4,48
,Cut to Mako and Korra as they venture through the spirit wilds.,9,4,48
Korra,Jinora!,9,4,48
Mako,"Hello, anyone? [Rustling of a vine sounds nearby.] Wait. Do you hear that?",9,4,48
,"The rustling intensifies as the shot cuts to inside a building and slowly zooms in on Korra and Mako. It cuts back to the outside of the building as three vines crash through the window and attack Mako and Korra. They both defend themselves with firebending and airbending, respectively, though Mako is taken and lifted into the air. Korra severs the vine with her firebending and uses another fire arc to keep the vines at a distance, while she and Mako retreat.",9,4,48
Korra,Come on!,9,4,48
,"Cut to a side-view inside a building as Korra breaks through the wall and runs inside. Mako is on her trail, though stops to release some fire punches at the incoming vines. Korra turns and uses her earthbending to close the hole and prevent the advancing vines from following them.",9,4,48
Mako,"Korra, look. [Shot turns around to show a bunch of green cocoons with people inside them.] What are those? [They walk closer up to them and Korra touches the nearest one, revealing that Jinora is inside.]",9,4,48
Korra,It's Jinora and the rest of them. Their spirits are trapped in the Spirit World.,9,4,48
Mako,[Makes a fire dagger.] Let's get them out.,9,4,48
Korra,"[Placing a hand on his shoulder and he lowers the dagger.] Don't! You'll provoke the vines. Let me try. [She bends water up to perform the spiritual healing technique, though it fails; frustrated.] They won't open. [Softer voice.] Maybe if I meditate into the Spirit World, I can free them.",9,4,48
,"She sits down and starts meditating. The frame zooms on her face as she leaves the physical world before zooming out to show her standing, her eyes closed. Korra stands on the flat top of a tall rock; several more like it stand nearby, poking up out of a foggy layer of clouds below. She opens her eyes and looks around.",9,4,48
Korra,Wait ... this isn't the Spirit World.,9,4,48
,"A sudden gust of wind whips her hair around her face; after a moment's hesitation, she turns around to see Zaheer behind her, floating in midair.",9,4,48
Korra,Zaheer! No!,9,4,48
,"Zaheer sends Korra tumbling across the surface of the rock with a blast of air. She slides to the edge of the column, where she lies stunned for a short moment. Rising, Korra firebends at him, but the fire dies and she kneels down again, clutching her left arm with which she had bent the fire in pain.",9,4,48
Zaheer,You can't fight me and the poison!,9,4,48
Korra,"[Raising her head, shocked.] No ... I got it out!",9,4,48
Zaheer,You'll never get it out!,9,4,48
,"He traps her in vortex of air and engulfs her head in a ball of air, before starting to bend the air out of her lungs, suffocating her. Korra jolts back into the real world, where she leans heavily on her hands, sweat dripping down her face and shoulders.",9,4,48
Mako,Korra! What's wrong?,9,4,48
Korra,"[Close-up shot of Korra, with a bead of sweat dripping down her nose.] It's Zaheer.",9,4,48
Mako,What are you talking about?,9,4,48
Korra,He's been haunting me ever since I fought him. I can't get any peace. It's like he's blocking me from meditating into the Spirit World. [Mako pulls her to her feet again.],9,4,48
Mako,I'm here for you. What do you need?,9,4,48
,"Cut to the police roadblock at the entrance to the wilds, where Korra and Mako are talking to Tenzin.",9,4,48
Korra,I want to face Zaheer.,9,4,48
Tenzin,"[A hand on his face.] Korra, he's too dangerous. Even when he's locked up, he can't be trusted.",9,4,48
Korra,I need to if I wanna save Jinora and the others. There's no other way.,9,4,48
Tenzin,There is another way. I'm calling your father. He can lead an expedition into the Spirit World from the Southern portal.,9,4,48
Korra,"[Somewhat downcast.] You've lost faith in me, too, haven't you? [She turns her head slightly away from Tenzin.] No one thinks I'm capable of anything anymore.",9,4,48
Tenzin,[Softly.] It's not that at all.,9,4,48
Korra,[Pleadingly.] I know I can do this.,9,4,48
Tenzin,"I'm just so worried for Jinora. I can't imagine if something happened to you, too.",9,4,48
Korra,"[Walking up to Tenzin, putting a hand on his shoulder.] Tenzin, please. I'll be okay.",9,4,48
Tenzin,[Thinks for a moment.] Zaheer's imprisoned deep in the mountains outside the city. I'll call Raiko and get the clearance.,9,4,48
Korra,[Hugs Tenzin.] Thank you.,9,4,48
,Cut to an aerial shot of Air Temple Island. Bolin is walking in the garden.,9,4,48
Bolin,"Pab-pabs, where are you? [Pabu appears in a tree behind him and jumps down into Bolin's arms.] Pabu! Oh, I missed you so much! [More dejected.] So, I don't know if you've heard, but Opal's kind of mad at me. I was hoping ... you could help me win her back. [Pabu chitters a few times; Bolin gets excited.] Awesome! Yes, I have an idea.",9,4,48
,"Cut to the outside of the temple where Opal is sitting on a set of steps, reading a book. Pabu runs up to her with a pink ribbon tied around his neck.",9,4,48
Opal,"Hello, Pabu. [The fire ferret keeps running circles around her before leaning on her book.] Well, it's good to see you, too. [Notices the ribbon, which has a note in it.] What do you got there?",9,4,48
,"Opal takes the note and reads it, suddenly getting a worried expression on her face. The scene shifts to Opal running through the greenery and toward a clearing where Bolin is sitting, pouring tea with a smile.",9,4,48
Bolin,"Opal, you made it!",9,4,48
Opal,What's this?,9,4,48
Bolin,"A picnic, just for the two of us! Well, the three of us. Sorry, Pabs.",9,4,48
Opal,"So, this note Pabu brought me saying you broke both of your legs was just a ruse?",9,4,48
Bolin,"Maybe ... but now that you're here, don't you want to just sit back, relax, try some of my homemade steam buns [Holds up a basket.] —Pema's recipe—and watch Pabu do some of his world-famous backflips for entertainment? Ha-hah!",9,4,48
Opal,"[Sarcastically.] Oh. Steam buns. My favorite. This will totally make me forget that you worked for Kuvira, the person who captured my family and is probably torturing them right now. So yeah, let's just sit down and have a great picnic because we're so in love! [Starts to leave, but briefly turns back.] I'm sorry you had to see that, Pabu. [She walks away as Bolin looks on sadly.]",9,4,48
,"Cut to Raiko's office inside of City Hall, where Raiko, Varrick, and Asami have gathered.",9,4,48
Raiko,Thank you both for coming.,9,4,48
Varrick,It's nice to be welcomed back with open arms.,9,4,48
Raiko,"Actually, I brought you here out of necessity. It's no secret I never liked you. Especially after you tried to have me kidnapped.",9,4,48
Varrick,Allegedly.,9,4,48
Asami,"[Scoffs.] Right. Everything you do is ""allegedly"". Like when you took over my company and bombed the Southern Water Tribe Cultural Center!",9,4,48
Varrick,I own that building! A man has a right to blow up his own property!,9,4,48
Raiko,"Right now, I need you to put aside your differences. If Kuvira really is creating a super weapon, we're going to need the two brightest minds in the city working together to stop it.",9,4,48
Varrick,"What do you say, Asami? [Holds out his hand.] Partners again?",9,4,48
Asami,"[Shakes Varrick's hand.] Fine. I'll help. [Starts to crush his hand.] But don't even think about double-crossing me again. [Varrick, in a lot of pain, nods weakly.]",9,4,48
,Cut to an aerial shot of Zaheer's prison within the mountains. Korra and Mako stand outside the building as the doors are opened.,9,4,48
Mako,Are you sure you're ready for this?,9,4,48
Korra,"Yes. I think if I see Zaheer chained up, I'll finally realize that he's not a threat anymore.",9,4,48
,"They walk up to the doors and into an elevator. The elevator moves down and lands underground. They walk up to another metal doorway, which a White Lotus sentry opens to reveal a wall.",9,4,48
White Lotus guard,"Approach the wall. [Korra and Mako start to head toward the wall, but Korra stops Mako.]",9,4,48
Korra,No. I need to do this alone.,9,4,48
,"She approaches the wall and the door behind her is lifted down. The elevator brings her down to Zaheer's room and the door opens when she gets there. She sees Zaheer, unshaven and chained up in mid-air.",9,4,48
Zaheer,I figured you would show up sooner or later. So ... you must really be in trouble if you came all the way down here to see me.,9,4,48
Korra,I came here to look you in the eye and tell you that you have no power over me. I will no longer be scared of you.,9,4,48
,Zaheer assumes a menacing facial expression and lunges at Korra. She gasps and steps back.,9,4,48
Zaheer,[Laughs.] I guess it didn't work. You still seem scared.,9,4,48
Korra,This was a mistake. [Starts to leave.],9,4,48
Zaheer,I know why you're here.,9,4,48
Korra,You don't know anything about me!,9,4,48
Zaheer,You can't go into the Spirit World. I spend most of my time in the Spirit World and it's well known that the Avatar's spirit hasn't been there for a few years.,9,4,48
Korra,You can meditate into the Spirit World from here? Doesn't feel very spiritually charged.,9,4,48
Zaheer,This is your problem. Republic City is flowing with spiritual energy and you can't even tap into it.,9,4,48
Korra,"No, my problem is you! You poisoned me! You've ruined me! People used to think I was unstoppable, but now they don't think I'm capable of anything!",9,4,48
Zaheer,"Blaming me is a crutch to make you feel better, but it's not helping you recover.",9,4,48
Korra,I thought seeing you face-to-face would put an end to all of this. But maybe it's time I realize I'll never be the same.,9,4,48
Zaheer,"Neither of us are the same as before. I learned to fly, but now I'm bound in chains. You have all the power in the world and the freedom to use it, but you choose to hold yourself down.",9,4,48
Korra,"I'm not holding myself down, but my powers have limits!",9,4,48
Zaheer,"You're wrong. That poison should've killed you, but you were able to fight it off. You think your power has limits; I say, it's limitless.",9,4,48
Korra,"Whatever. Before, you were always talking about chaos and freedom. Then you took out the Earth Queen and created the worst dictator the Earth Kingdom has ever seen. Thanks for that!",9,4,48
Zaheer,"I've heard rumors about her, but I didn't know she achieved so much power. She needs to be stopped.",9,4,48
Korra,"Well, I can't stop her unless I get over this block.",9,4,48
Zaheer,I think I can help. Let me lead you into the Spirit World.,9,4,48
Korra,No way. I can't trust you.,9,4,48
Zaheer,"Maybe not. But if you had any other options, you wouldn't be here now, would you? We may have been enemies once, but for now, our interests align.",9,4,48
Korra,I've come this far. What have I got to lose? [Sits down to meditate.],9,4,48
Zaheer,"[As they pass over.] Focus on the sound of my voice and clear your mind. [Korra remembers her fight with Zaheer at the Northern Air Temple, and he begins to suffocate her.] Let it play out.",9,4,48
Korra,I can't!,9,4,48
Zaheer,You can. Accept what happened to you. Don't fear what might have been.,9,4,48
Korra,I have no control!,9,4,48
Zaheer,[As Korra falls into a massive vortex of air.] Don't be afraid. Hold on!,9,4,48
,"Korra crashes through the rocky ground, but finds herself in the meadows of the Spirit World.",9,4,48
Korra,I made it ... and you led me here. Do you know where Jinora and the others are?,9,4,48
Zaheer,"No, but you do.",9,4,48
,He heads back into the physical world. Raava lights up inside of Korra.,9,4,48
Korra,"Raava, I missed you. Where have you been?",9,4,48
Raava,I have always been inside of you.,9,4,48
Korra,"Can you help me find Jinora? [The wind blows Korra to the location of Jinora and Ryu's tour group. They are all trapped inside of a green, spherical force field.] How do I release their spirits?",9,4,48
Raava,You must bend the energy within.,9,4,48
Korra,But I'm powerless in the Spirit World.,9,4,48
Raava,"No. You're most powerful here. In the Spirit World, you're connected to all the spiritual energy.",9,4,48
,"Korra walks over to the force field and puts her hand on it. Her eyes glow and the force field becomes a golden yellow, signifying the release of the spirits. Cut to Jinora and the tour group being released from their vines.",9,4,48
Ryu,Ugh ... I feel all spirity.,9,4,48
Jinora,[Runs out of the Spirit Wilds and hugs Tenzin.] Dad!,9,4,48
Tenzin,I'm so glad you're safe. What happened? How did you get out?,9,4,48
Jinora,Korra saved us.,9,4,48
,Cut back to Korra and Mako walking out of the prison.,9,4,48
Mako,So ... how are you doing?,9,4,48
Korra,I feel ... whole again. I feel good.,9,4,48
Mako,Do you think you're finally able to forget about what Zaheer did to you?,9,4,48
Korra,No. But I am finally able to accept what happened and I think that's gonna make me stronger.,9,4,48
,Cut back to Air Temple Island. Lin is on top of a bison and Opal is handing her the last of the belongings they are taking on their mission. Bolin runs to a spot near them.,9,4,48
Bolin,Where are you going?,9,4,48
Opal,We've got some family business to take care of.,9,4,48
Bolin,"All right, listen. Before you go, I just want to tell you that I understand how you feel. I know there is nothing I could do or no big gesture that could make up for all my mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying to win you back because ... I love you.",9,4,48
Opal,"Thanks for saying all of that. [Bolin starts to leave, but stops when she keeps talking.] You know ... there is one thing you could do to win me back.",9,4,48
Bolin,"[Eagerly.] What is it? Yes, I'll do anything!",9,4,48
Opal,[Turns to face him.] Come on a secret mission with us.,9,4,48
Bolin,Where to?,9,4,48
Opal,Zaofu. We're going to rescue my family. [Bolin's facial expression becomes more serious.],9,4,48
,Cut to credits.,9,4,48
,"The scene opens to the camera, tracking left to right to show Opal's sky bison landing on the outskirts of Zaofu. Opal and Bolin get off the bison together.",10,4,49
Bolin,"All right, let's do this! [To Opal.] Saving the Beifongs and saving our love, because I vow to repair the rift that has grown betwixt us and make us whole again!",10,4,49
Lin Beifong,"[Angrily, walking between the two and giving Bolin a shove.] You. Zip it. Now. I had enough of your babble on the way in.",10,4,49
Bolin,"[Timidly.] Yes, ma'am.",10,4,49
,"All three of them walk to the edge of the mountainside, crouching out of sight and looking down at the city.",10,4,49
Opal,Kuvira tore down all the domes. Why would she do that?,10,4,49
Lin,"[Pulling out a spyglass, surveying the city.] She's got a whole battalion of troops stationed there. There's no way we'll be able to spot anything useful from here. We'll have to go in for a closer look.",10,4,49
,"A voice speaks from behind them and they all turns their heads; Toph Beifong is walking up behind them, speaking in a mater-of-fact tone.",10,4,49
Toph,Don't bother. All the prisoners have been moved.,10,4,49
Lin,"[Shocked by her mother's sudden appearance.] Uh ... hey, Chief.",10,4,49
Toph,"Hey, Chief.",10,4,49
Opal,[Runs and hugs Toph.] Grandma Toph!,10,4,49
Toph,You were only up to my waist the last time we were together.,10,4,49
Bolin,"[Excited.] Oh, man! Ohh, I can't. This can't be happening! [He waves hands in his face, becoming hysterical.]",10,4,49
Toph,What?! Do you have to pee or something? [Opal giggles.],10,4,49
Bolin,"No ... well, now, maybe. You're my hero! My name is Bolin. I'm dating your granddaughter, I mean, kind of. I may have screwed that up, but that's why I'm here and you're my hero! Oh, I said that. Can I have a hug too?",10,4,49
Toph,What's up with him?,10,4,49
Lin,"He's an actor. So, you already checked the city for Su? How did you know she was captured?",10,4,49
Toph,I've been living in the swamp and keeping watch on Zaofu through the vines.,10,4,49
Bolin,"Sure, okay, makes sense.",10,4,49
Toph,"By the time I got here, they were gone. I snooped around town and heard that they were taken away to some nearby prison camp.",10,4,49
Opal,[Turns to Bolin with newfound bitterness in her voice.] Where would that be?,10,4,49
Bolin,[Ashamed.] There's a factory and reeducation facility not too far away.,10,4,49
Toph,[Disbelieving.] How do you know that?,10,4,49
Opal,Bolin used to work for Kuvira.,10,4,49
Toph,[Confused and agitated.] How did you end up dating the kind of dipstick who works for Kuvira?,10,4,49
Bolin,"[Pleading his case.] ""Used to""!",10,4,49
Lin,"[Begins to walk away.] It's not his silver tongue, I can tell you that. [Toph and Opal follow.]",10,4,49
Bolin,"[Hastens after the group, disappointed.] Please tell me this attitude isn't hereditary.",10,4,49
,Cut to a shot of Opal's bison panting as dark-green mucus drips from its nose. The bison proceeds to lick Opal.,10,4,49
Opal,"Grandma, this is Juicy.",10,4,49
Toph,"[Repulsed.] And I thought Appa was smelly. Why would you choose this leaky, nasty thing?",10,4,49
Opal,"[While Juicy nuzzles her.] You don't choose your bison. He chooses you. [She pats her bison.] And once he chooses you, you can't change. Believe me, I checked.",10,4,49
,"Cut to City Hall, Republic City. The shot shows the exterior, but Raiko's voice can be heard, from off-screen as the shot proceeds.",10,4,49
Raiko,"The borders are secure and troops are guarding the rail lines into the city. [Cut to City Hall interior, where Raiko is addressing Varrick and Asami. Mako, Korra, Wu, and Tenzin are also present.] So what have you two geniuses come up with to fend off Kuvira?",10,4,49
Varrick,"[As Asami displays schematics.] It's a flying mecha suit! [Strikes schematics, to Asami's annoyance.] Asami got the idea from watching dragonfly-hummingbirds. You can take off straight up, fly in any direction—",10,4,49
Raiko,[Interrupting.] Where does the spirit ray come out?,10,4,49
Varrick,[Coldly.] It doesn't have a spirit ray. I'm telling you what I told Kuvira: That technology should not be used!,10,4,49
Raiko,[Angry.] It's already being used by Kuvira! I need spirit vine weapons and I need them now!,10,4,49
Korra,[Firmly.] No. It was Kuvira's harvesting of the vines in the swamp that caused the Republic City vines to go crazy and grab all those people.,10,4,49
Raiko,You're supposed to be the bridge between the two worlds. Why can't you harvest the vines?,10,4,49
Korra,"I won't do that. But maybe since the spirits love Republic City so much, I can convince them to help us defend it somehow.",10,4,49
Raiko,[Nods curtly.] Hm.,10,4,49
Wu,"Okay, maybe while the weapon geniuses and the spirit bridge are getting ready for battle, we should be evacuating the ordinary citizens so that if Kuvira attacks, they won't be hurt.",10,4,49
Raiko,"[Taken aback.] That's ... actually a good idea. [Regaining composure.] Prince Wu, you work with the police to coordinate getting people out of the city. Now everyone get to it. I want daily updates.",10,4,49
,Cut to outside of council chamber. Mako walks with Wu.,10,4,49
Mako,Nice job in there. I'm proud of you. You're starting to act like the kind of king I'd like to work for.,10,4,49
Wu,"Thanks. [Smugly.] And if Korra buys this ""man of the people"" thing, I still might get to date her.",10,4,49
Mako,[Rather disappointed.] You always have to ruin it.,10,4,49
Wu,"What? Come on! Why do you think guys do anything great? To pick up girls. Every work of art, every song, every city evacuation, all for the ladies. [Walks off while Mako stares in disbelief.]",10,4,49
,Cut to Kuvira's factory. Scene zooms in on the facility housing a large cannon.,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,"[Off-screen.] All right, everybody, let's test the power core. [Cut to a shot of Baatar, Zhu Li, two scientists, and two mecha tanks.] I want everything in order for the full demonstration for Kuvira tomorrow. Load the energy capsule.",10,4,49
,The two mecha tanks lower a spirit vine capsule into the cannon.,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,"Zhu Li, initialize phase one.",10,4,49
,"Zhu Li pushes up a lever and a current runs through the spirit vine sample; coursing with energy, it begins to radiate its characteristic purplish glow. Cut to the opening of the cannon's turret, where an ball of purple energy has begun to materialize. As Baatar Jr. watches with silent satisfaction, the meters on the machine begin to go haywire while a warning light flashes and an alarm sounds.",10,4,49
Zhu Li,There's a problem with the condenser. It's backing up!,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,[Reluctantly.] Shut it down.,10,4,49
Zhu Li,"[Lowers the lever, though nothing happens.] I can't. The override isn't working. Everyone needs to evacuate. This thing is going to blow!",10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,[Urgently.] Everyone get out! Now!,10,4,49
,The two scientists and mecha tanks jump over a rail to escape. Baatar Jr. and Zhu Li remain. The former opens up a box to check the cannon's circuitry.,10,4,49
Zhu Li,"Come on, Baatar! It's too late!",10,4,49
,"Baatar Jr. reaches into the cannon's circuitry and shuts down the firing sequence. The vine sample in the capsule stops glowing and shrivels up. After searching for a few seconds, Baatar Jr. finds the reason for the malfunction and stares in disbelief at the cracked metal ring.",10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,[Holding up the cracked ring.] This channeling ring was cracked. That's what caused the reaction to overload. [Angrily.] Now we're taking this whole thing apart tonight and checking everything! Nothing is too small. This has to be ready by tomorrow.,10,4,49
,Cut to a shot of Juicy flying over to the factory.,10,4,49
Bolin,[To Lin and Toph.] So how long as it been since you two have seen each other?,10,4,49
Toph,"[Relaxed. Lin, however, has her arms crossed.] Little while now. Couple of years. [Lin turns to her mother.]",10,4,49
Lin,Try twenty.,10,4,49
Toph,"Ah, time flies when you get to be my age. I'm surprised you came to save Su. I thought you guys didn't get along.",10,4,49
Lin,[Arms still crossed.] Su and I finally worked out our old grievances.,10,4,49
Toph,"[Lying back on the saddle.] Good, glad we can put all that behind us.",10,4,49
Lin,"[Sarcastically.] Right. ""We"".",10,4,49
,Juicy touches down behind some rocks on the outskirts of the factory. Cut to view of factory.,10,4,49
Bolin,"[Voice-over.] Okay, there's the factory.",10,4,49
,"The group reaches the factory and Toph metalbends an opening in the wall. After she, Opal, Bolin, and Lin enter, the opening is metalbent shut just before a mecha tank on patrol passes by. Cut to inside the factory where the group continues to hide behind boxes to maintain stealth.",10,4,49
Bolin,"[Sees the cannon.] Whoa, that's one big ... thing.",10,4,49
Toph,"[Stamps her foot to get a seismic reading of the area. Concentrates for a moment.] I think I know where they are. Feel that cavern a few stories down? It seems empty, but it's guarded by an awful lot of mech.",10,4,49
Lin,"[Stamps her foot to confirm Toph's reading.] Right. Why would you need soldiers guarding an empty cavern? They must have them in some kind of suspended prison, so they can't use their earthbending. [A door suddenly begins to open.]",10,4,49
Bolin,Someone's coming. Hide!,10,4,49
,"The doors open to reveal Kuvira, who is escorted by a pair of mecha tanks. They stand before the cannon. Baatar Jr., Zhu Li, and some associates walk up behind them.",10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,I didn't expect you until tomorrow.,10,4,49
Kuvira,[Gazing up at the cannon.] I just wanted to check in to make sure everything was on track. It looks wonderful.,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,"We've had a few minor malfunctions, but we should be ready for the test tomorrow.",10,4,49
Kuvira,"[Turns to Zhu Li.] You've been working on this the entire time, Zhu Li. What do you think the problem is?",10,4,49
Zhu Li,It's a very complex machine. There are bound to be some bugs to work out.,10,4,49
Kuvira,"But you're doing everything you can to fix those, correct?",10,4,49
Zhu Li,"Of course, your eminence.",10,4,49
,"Cut to Toph, Bolin, Lin, and Opal.",10,4,49
Toph,She's lying. [Bolin lights up at this revelation.],10,4,49
,"Cut back to Kuvira, who is addressing her subordinates.",10,4,49
Kuvira,Tell the troops and the factory workers to attend tomorrow's demonstration. I want them all to witness this incredible new weapon in action.,10,4,49
,"Cut to Opal, Lin, Toph, and Bolin, who leave the scene. Scene changes to the outskirts of the factory.",10,4,49
Opal,[Voice-over.] We should be thinking of a way to take out Kuvira while we have the chance.,10,4,49
Bolin,"Or at least destroy the cannon. If she takes that to Republic City, it could obliterate everything.",10,4,49
Toph,I didn't come to fight with Kuvira or destroy a cannon. I'm here to save my family. [Gestures with her hand.] It will take everything we have just to get out alive. [Clenches both fists.],10,4,49
Bolin,"[Thinks for a moment.] Hmm. Kuvira wants every single one of her people to see the weapon test tomorrow, so the factory will be mostly empty then. That's our best chance to sneak in and free Su without being spotted.",10,4,49
Opal,"[Mildly impressed.] Good thinking, Bolin.",10,4,49
Bolin,Thanks. [Puts a hand to his head.] I kind of have a headache now.,10,4,49
,Scene changes to Republic City's Spirit Wilds. Korra walks along and sees a small yellow spirit with two leaves on its head.,10,4,49
Korra,"[Waving enthusiastically.] Excuse me, spirit? Can I talk to ... [The spirit vanishes from sight.] and you're gone. [Korra turns around and sees more spirits vanishing from the wilds.] Just like all the other spirits. [Understanding dawns on her.] They're abandoning the city.",10,4,49
,"Cut to an overhead view of Lin, Opal, Bolin, and Toph gathered around a stone table.",10,4,49
Bolin,"[To Toph.] So let me ask you about metalbending. Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.",10,4,49
Toph,"[While Opal and Bolin listen, Lin sits to the side and picks at her food.] I used to have an academy to train metalbending. Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.",10,4,49
Lin,"Yeah, you're a real sensitive instructor.",10,4,49
Bolin,I did learn how to lavabend.,10,4,49
Toph,[Somewhat impressed.] Really? It's a very rare ability. [Smiles.] Maybe you do have some talent.,10,4,49
Bolin,[Excited.] I can't believe ... you think I'm talented? [Fans himself.] That means so much to me coming from my hero.,10,4,49
Lin,"Yeah, she's real encouraging.",10,4,49
Toph,"Hey! I'm blind, not deaf.",10,4,49
Bolin,So here's something I've always been curious about: Who's Lin's dad?,10,4,49
,Lin whirls around with her eyebrows furrowed and her lips pursed. A moment of silence ensues.,10,4,49
Toph,"He was a guy named Kanto. Nice man, but it didn't really work out between us.",10,4,49
Bolin,And ... [Realizing Toph is not going to reveal anything more.] okay.,10,4,49
Toph,"Lin, I can feel your enraged breathing from here. Just say what you have to say and let's get it over with.",10,4,49
Lin,"[Agitated.] Just get it over with? Yeah, let's not linger on the fact that I grew up without a dad. No need to get all touchy-feely about it. Just one of those things, right?",10,4,49
Toph,"Hey, I forgave you for all your garbage a long time ago and Su and I worked things out. [Cut to Opal and Bolin sitting, awkwardly holding their cups of noodles.] You're the only one who wants to hold on to this family drama nonsense [Bolin eats a mouthful of noodles.] for the rest of your life. [Bolin picks up some more noodles.]",10,4,49
Lin,"[Voice-over.] Forgave me for what?! [Bolin and Opal turn to Lin.] And not knowing my dad is nonsense to you? [Bolin continues to eat his noodles while watching the exchange.] It was pretty important to me. [Cut to Lin.] And until now, you would never even discuss it. You know, after Su and I patched things up, I thought, ""maybe I should try to reach out to mom."" [Cut to Toph.] But now that we're together again, I remember why we stopped talking. [Toph's eyebrows furrow.] You make me furious [Cut back to Lin.] and you don't even know why. And when I tell you, you don't care. [Cut back to Toph.] Once we save Su, you and I are finished.",10,4,49
Toph,"[Closes her eyes and sighs.] If that's your decision and it makes you happy, then fine.",10,4,49
,"Lin crosses her arms while Bolin continues to eat his noodles. Cut to the interior of Kuvira's factory. It is dark, but the wheels of the vehicle upon which the cannon rests are visible. The doors suddenly open, allowing the light outside to illuminate the chamber. The vehicle begins to crawl outside. Opal lands on a vantage point overlooking the cannon. She whispers into a two-way radio.",10,4,49
Opal,The test is about to start. They're going to blow up that empty town we flew over yesterday. [Camera pans to the town.] You're clear to go.,10,4,49
Lin,"[Voice-over.] Copy that. [Cut to Lin, Toph, and Bolin, who have taken down three of Kuvira's sentries.] We're clear to go.",10,4,49
,"Lin, Toph, and Bolin jump into a pit. The scene changes to an underground chamber; Toph opens up a hole in the rock to allow an entry into the prison. Cut to an underside view of a wooden container suspended in midair by ropes. Cut back to Bolin, Toph, and Lin who are analyzing the container.",10,4,49
Toph,"[Referring to a door on the side of the cavern opposite them.] The guards are on the other side of that door. [Cut to Suyin, who sees the group.] We'll have to be quiet.",10,4,49
Lin,"[Suyin touches Baatar's shoulder and he turns around to look.] Shoot me over to the cage [Cut back to Bolin, Toph, and Lin.] and I can swing them back on my cable. [Turns to face Bolin.] Bolin, you'll have to catch them since mom won't be able to see them. [Bolin nods. Lin bends down.] Ready?",10,4,49
,"Toph walks to the side and she and Bolin both earthbend a rock column to propel Lin into the air, who lands on top of the wooden cage. It shakes from the impact and the prisoners all grunt from the motion. Cut to a guard, who bursts through the door on the other side of the cavern and looks up at the shaking wooden cage suspiciously. It stills and the guard turns around to leave, closing the door behind him. Toph uses earthbending to create another opening from which Bolin can catch the prisoners. Cut to the inside of the cage and pan up to see Lin having cleaved an opening from the top.",10,4,49
Lin,We'll get you out one at a time. Come on.,10,4,49
,"Cut back to an underside view of the cage; Lin lowers Wei to Bolin, who catches him.",10,4,49
Bolin,I got you!,10,4,49
,"Wei pats Bolin on the cheek, to the latter's surprise. Cut back to the surface, where Kuvira's subordinates have gathered at the cannon to hear her speak.",10,4,49
Kuvira,"Congratulations on all of your hard work. [Close-up of Kuvira.] This weapon is proof that the Earth Empire is the strongest nation in the world. And believe me, this is only the beginning! [Crowd cheers off-screen. Kuvira turns to Baatar Jr.] Fire the weapon.",10,4,49
,"Baatar Jr. pushes up the lever to commence the cannon's firing sequence. The spirit vine in the capsule begins to glow purple. Cut to Baatar, Zhu Li, and Kuvira observing the weapon. Suddenly, an alarm sounds, surprising the three.",10,4,49
Kuvira,What's wrong?,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,[Cut to inside of box containing the cannon's circuitry.] Probably something minor. [The cover opens to reveal the insides are smoking and Baatar peers in.] I should be able to find the problem. [The machine powers down. Baatar Jr. looks around and becomes surprised.] The distributor pin is gone. [Wipes his hands on a cloth.] I swear I locked it in place yesterday. There's no way it could have just fallen out. [Turns to Kuvira.],10,4,49
Kuvira,And this could cause the entire weapon to fail?,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,It could cause it to explode.,10,4,49
Kuvira,[Turns to face Zhu Li.] What do you know about this?,10,4,49
,"Kuvira approaches Zhu Li, who begins to back away into the control panel.",10,4,49
Zhu Li,Nothing.,10,4,49
Kuvira,[Metalbends the distributor pin from Zhu Li's pocket and lets it twirl in front of them.] You swore your loyalty to me and I gave you a chance at greatness. [Grabs the pin in anger.] This is how you repay me?!,10,4,49
Zhu Li,"[Afraid, but turns resolute.] You're a monster. I regret nothing.",10,4,49
Kuvira,[Seizes Zhu Li and throws her to Baatar Jr.] Chain her up in the target town. She can see how the weapon works [Cut to Opal's vantage point.] up close and personal.,10,4,49
Opal,"[Close-up.] Oh, no.",10,4,49
,Cut back to underground prison. All the prisoners have been freed save for Suyin and Baatar.,10,4,49
Suyin,"[Reassuring Baatar Sr., who has pinned himself to a corner of the cage.] Sweetie, it'll be fine. Lin won't drop you and Bolin will catch you.",10,4,49
Baatar,"[Perspiring from fear.] No, no. Just go. Just leave me. I'll stay here. [Closes eyes.]",10,4,49
Lin,"[Lin and Suyin give each other a look; Suyin shrugs. Lin turns back to Baatar.] Sorry, but I have to do this.",10,4,49
,"Lin metalbends a cable around Baatar's right leg. Cut to Baatar swinging upside down from Lin's cable while screaming. The noise alerts the guard, who activates an alarm. A mecha tank steps behind him to assist. Cut to the wooden cage, where Suyin looks to the guard with worry; cut back to Baatar, who has landed in Bolin's arms, whimpering. Cut to Kuvira, who hears the alarm and whirls to face one of her guards.",10,4,49
Kuvira,The prison. Get there now!,10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,Should we postpone the test?,10,4,49
Kuvira,I didn't come all this way to stop now. Fire when ready. I want to see that town destroyed.,10,4,49
,"Scene shifts back to the prison, where the mecha tank assaults Lin and Suyin with its flamethrower. Lin uses her metal cables to sever two of the ropes keeping the cage suspended. The cage begins to swing to the side of the cavern where the other prisoners landed and Lin and Suyin both leap from the cage to reunite with the rest. Suyin hugs Toph.",10,4,49
Bolin,[Into a two-way radio.] We got 'em. We're coming out.,10,4,49
,"Scene shifts to the surface, where Lin, Bolin, and Suyin emerge from a hole and observe their surroundings before bursting out with the others. Suyin sees Opal, who glides down and pulls out her bison whistle to summon Juicy.",10,4,49
Opal,Mom! Dad! [Hugs both before turning to Bolin.] Thank you. [Bolin smiles softly at her.],10,4,49
Lin,[Urgently.] Let's move.,10,4,49
Opal,Kuvira caught Zhu Li and threw her in the town.,10,4,49
Bolin,"What? [Stands up.] No, I have to go save her.",10,4,49
Lin,"You can't go in there, kid. It's suicide. Kuvira's onto us.",10,4,49
Bolin,"We've been through too much together. I can't leave her. Toph, you said Zhu Li was lying about fixing the cannon. She must have been trying to stop it.",10,4,49
Toph,"For all you know, she could just have been covering her butt because she made a mistake.",10,4,49
Bolin,"[Adamant.] No, Zhu Li doesn't make mistakes. You guys leave. If we make it out, we'll make it to the city somehow.",10,4,49
Opal,"Bolin, no! [Turns to see Juicy fly in. Airbends herself onto Juicy.] You guys get out of here. I have to go with Bolin. [Flies off.]",10,4,49
Suyin,[Turns to Lin.] Could be our best chance to stop Kuvira.,10,4,49
Lin,[Considers.] Maybe take out that weapon.,10,4,49
Wing,We can't let Opal be the coolest!,10,4,49
Toph,"If you all want to get yourselves captured again or worse, that's your business. I'm through.",10,4,49
Suyin,"[Places hand on Toph's back.] Watch out for Baatar Sr. and Huan. [She, Lin, Wei, and Wing head off to face Kuvira.]",10,4,49
Baatar,"So how have you been, mother?",10,4,49
Toph,"I told you never to call me that. [Baatar looks away, crestfallen.]",10,4,49
,"Cut to Republic City with a back view of Korra. Cut to a close-up of her face, eyes closed in concentration. Korra meditates into the Spirit World, finding herself at the Tree of Time, where multiple spirits have gathered.",10,4,49
Korra,"Spirits, this is the Avatar. [Korra turns around to face the spirits behind her.] Please listen to me. [Camera focuses on these spirits and pans to each one, even as more spirits continue to materialize.] Since I opened the portals, spirits and humans have lived happily together in Republic City. It's all I could have hoped for. I know you felt the effects of Kuvira cutting down spirit vines. But now isn't the time for you to flee the city. [Camera focuses back on Korra.] It's time for you to help me save it from Kuvira, who was perverting spirit power to use as a weapon against other humans. [A serpentine spirit with a beak descends from behind Korra.]",10,4,49
Dragon eel spirit,We don't [Korra whirls to face him.] get involved with human wars.,10,4,49
Korra,Spirits worked with Unalaq.,10,4,49
Dragon eel spirit,He was misusing Vaatu's power during Harmonic Convergence to force spirits to fight you. Is that what you want?,10,4,49
Korra,"No, but as the Avatar, I'm hoping that you will come to my aid to save the new world we all share.",10,4,49
Dragon eel spirit,[Camera focuses on the serpentine spirit with all his spirit companions gathered behind him.] What you want is exactly what Kuvira wants: to use spirits as a weapon in a human war. [The spirit and his companions begin to fade away.] The answer is no.,10,4,49
Korra,"Wait! Please, listen. [The spirits continue to fade away.] If spirits and humans are gonna live together, we have to work with each other! [Sighs.]",10,4,49
,"Cut back to Kuvira's factory. The cannon's turret slides into place, focusing its sights on the town. Baatar Jr. pushes up the lever to fire the weapon and looks through a pair of binoculars. He spies Opal, Bolin, and Juicy near Zhu Li.",10,4,49
Baatar Jr.,[Peering through the binoculars.] Opal? No! [Faces Kuvira.] We have to stop the test!,10,4,49
,"The cannon continues to gather energy, but before the blast is released, earthbending pummels the side of the cannon, knocking it to one side, disrupting its aim. The beam punches a smoldering hole into a rock face directly behind Bolin, Opal, Juicy, and Zhu Li. The group regards the hole in shock.",10,4,49
Opal,Whoa.,10,4,49
,"Kuvira looks for the source of the disruption and spots Suyin, Lin, Wei, and Wing. The Beifongs exchange blows with Kuvira's soldiers, but the battle reaches a stalemate with both sides hiding behind earth walls. Seeing an opening, Suyin goes to engage Kuvira atop the cannon, but her former protégée manages to stand her ground. Suyin is knocked from the tank by Kuvira, but Wei and Wing help their mother retreat. However, the Beifongs are eventually surrounded by Kuvira's soldiers and mecha tanks. Before the group is captured, however, the earth beneath the soldiers and tanks shifts and knocks them all down. The Beifongs turn around and realize that Toph returned to save them. She is accompanied by Baatar, Huan, Juicy, Opal, Bolin, and Zhu Li.",10,4,49
Toph,[Pointing to Kuvira.] You give metalbenders a bad name!,10,4,49
,"Cut to a close-up of Kuvira as she processes Toph's words. Her gaze shifts up while the whoosh of Juicy's takeoff is heard. Cut to a back-view of Kuvira as she watching the bison depart with Bolin, Zhu Li, and the Beifongs. Cut to Bolin, Zhu Li, and Lin staring back at the site with concern. Scene shifts to the group in a forested area.",10,4,49
Suyin,"Thanks for coming to save us, Mom.",10,4,49
Lin,"Yeah, thanks, Chief. [Pauses briefly.] I'm sorry for what I said last night. I was just ... you know.",10,4,49
Toph,"Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway. If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.",10,4,49
Lin,Me too. [Hugs her mother.],10,4,49
Bolin,"You know, I never had any family except for my brother [Moves to link an arm around Toph and Lin, much to their surprise.] until a few years ago, [Pulls them close.] and reuniting with them made me realize how special it is.",10,4,49
Toph,"Argh, enough! [Escapes Bolin's embrace, causing Bolin to collide with Lin.] Enjoy the ride back to the city [Lin shoves Bolin aside.] with the gum flapper here.",10,4,49
Opal,"Aren't you coming back to Republic City with us, Grandma?",10,4,49
Toph,"No, my fighting days are over. Don't tell Korra, but my back is killing me now. This is why you didn't see Katara messing with that civil war nonsense. At some point, you gotta leave it to the kids. [Walks off.]",10,4,49
Zhu Li,I want to thank you for coming back to save me. And don't be too hard on Bolin for working with Kuvira. His heart was in the right place.,10,4,49
Opal,[Playfully.] I think Bolin has worked his way out of the polar bear doghouse. [Kisses his cheek.],10,4,49
Bolin,[Smiling triumphantly.] Yes! [Laughs.],10,4,49
Zhu Li,We should get going. I'm afraid I have bad news to deliver to Republic City. [Cut to close-up of Zhu Li's face.] Kuvira is going to attack in two weeks.,10,4,49
,"Cut to a shocked Suyin, Lin, Bolin, and Opal.",10,4,49
,Cut to credits.,10,4,49
,"The scene opens with a far shot of the city of Zaofu in broad daylight. The view cuts to the central square in the city, where a number of soldiers are gathered, standing at attention facing toward the front steps of the city's government building. Kuvira's voice is heard, addressing the soldiers from the top of the steps.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"Today, we stand on the precipice of history. For the past three years, [The view changes to a perspective from the soldiers' position, looking up at Kuvira, who stands at a podium.] we've fought side by side to unite the Earth Empire and we've proven that no one can stand in our way, [Cut to a close-up of Kuvira's face as she speaks, a map of the Earth Empire visible behind her.] not even the Avatar. But our mission is not yet complete.",11,4,50
,"Cut to two soldiers in a outpost in the mountains, listening to Kuvira's speech via a radio.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"[Over the radio.] There is a grave injustice that must be corrected. As you all know, after the Hundred Year War, Avatar Aang, [Cut to three other soldiers listening to Kuvira's speech over the radio.] along with Fire Lord Zuko, stole Earth Empire land and formed the United Republic. [Cut back to the map, showing the unoccupied space where the United Republic lies, before zooming out to show Kuvira's face.] This land belongs to the people of the Earth Empire and it's time to take it back! Republic City will be ours!",11,4,50
,"The soldiers all snap to attention, chanting in unison.",11,4,50
Soldiers,All hail the Great Uniter!,11,4,50
,"Kuvira leaves the podium, with Baatar Jr. walking alongside her. Kuvira turns toward him as they walk.",11,4,50
Kuvira,Are you ready to show the world what a true superpower looks like?,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"[They stop walking, looking at each other.] Yes. I'm honored to march into the city by your side. [They take each others' hands.] I love you, Kuvira.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"I never could have done this without your help. After we claim victory, we can finally get married [Kuvira and Baatar Jr. embrace one another.] and rule our empire together.",11,4,50
,"The shot zooms onto Kuvira, who closes her eyes after a short moment. Cut to an exterior shot of City Hall in Republic City, before cutting to Raiko's office, where Raiko, Wu, Korra, Mako, and Tenzin sit around a table, on which lies a map of the city itself.",11,4,50
Korra,How's the evacuation coming?,11,4,50
Wu,Could be better. [Cut to a close-up of Wu.] At this point we've evacuated almost ... [Consults his papers.] eighteen families.,11,4,50
Korra,[Distressed.] Only eighteen? There are millions of people in this city!,11,4,50
Wu,I said it could be better.,11,4,50
Mako,"The problem is, it's a voluntary evacuation and there aren't very many volunteers. They just don't feel like they're in any immediate danger.",11,4,50
,The conversation comes to an abrupt halt as Bolin bursts through the doors of the office.,11,4,50
Bolin,"Guys! Good, you're all here!",11,4,50
Raiko,"[Standing up, as Lin, Suyin and, Zhu Li enter the room; angrily.] What's with you interrupting my important meetings all the time?",11,4,50
Korra,[Standing up as well.] Su ... what are you ... you're okay! [The two women exchange a hug.] I'm so sorry about Zaofu. How did you escape?,11,4,50
Bolin,"Opal, Beifong, and I rescued everyone. But we had a run in with Kuvira. We saw her super spirit weapon up close. Like, really close. Way too close.",11,4,50
Tenzin,Is she going to use it against Republic City?,11,4,50
Zhu Li,Yes. I found out she's going to attack in two weeks.,11,4,50
Bolin,"Ooh! And Zhu Li's on our side now. Actually, she never really switched sides and I'm just gonna let her explain the whole thing. Zhu Li?",11,4,50
Zhu Li,"[Cut to a close-up of Zhu Li.] I pretended to be loyal to Kuvira so I could sabotage her weapon. It didn't work, but I did overhear her plans to attack.",11,4,50
Raiko,[Angrily.] I knew she wouldn't stop at Zaofu.,11,4,50
Lin,"My guess is, she's coming by rail. It's the only way she can transport that weapon.",11,4,50
Korra,Then we'll cut the rail lines.,11,4,50
Raiko,I agree. But let's get as many citizens evacuated before we do. [To Mako.] Put out the announcement. The evacuation is now mandatory.,11,4,50
Mako,[Stands up.] We're on it.,11,4,50
Korra,Don't worry Mr. President. I won't let Kuvira take our city.,11,4,50
,"Cut to the outside of a Future Industries factory. Transition inside, where workers are busy fastening bolts and welding. Cut to Varrick standing on a balcony above the assembly floor, addressing the workers.",11,4,50
Varrick,Weld hotter! Tighten tighter! [Cut to overhead view of several flying mecha suits. Camera pans left.] The president said we only have two weeks to get these hummingbirds humming!,11,4,50
,"Cut to Varrick's face. He places two hands behind his ears and closes his eyes as he hums. Behind him, Bolin walks through a set of doors and addresses him.",11,4,50
Bolin,"Varrick! Good, you're here. [Varrick turns to face Bolin.] Can I talk to you for a minute?",11,4,50
Varrick,[Slouching against the railing of the balcony.] What is it? I'm busy inspiring my workers.,11,4,50
Bolin,"Well, I went to Zaofu and saved Su and her family ... and guess who else we found? [Gesturing in presentation.] Ha!",11,4,50
,"On cue, Zhu Li walks through the doors, looking slightly unnerved. Varrick, seeing her, straightens up, his eyes widening in surprise.",11,4,50
Varrick,Zhu Li.,11,4,50
Bolin,"[As Zhu Li looks more heartened, a soft smile on her face.] Now, isn't there something you wanted to say to her? Hmm?",11,4,50
Zhu Li,"[Stepping toward Varrick.] Please, let me go first. I know I said a lot of terrible things about you in front of Kuvira. But I need you to know ... [Places a hand on her chest.] I didn't mean one word. When you were being taken away, I thought my only chance to save you was to join her. [Close-up shot of Varrick's face; he looks touched by her devotion.] But every day, I hoped for the chance to see you again and tell you the truth. [Cut to Zhu Li's face.] Varrick, you mean the world to me and I'm sorry if I hurt you in any way.",11,4,50
Varrick,"[Cut back to Varrick, who speaks softly.] Don't be so hard on yourself. [He moves his hand toward Zhu Li as if intending to cup her face, though he suddenly drops it to her shoulder and his voice is full of newfound exuberance.] Apology accepted! Now be a good assistant and [Turns to face the hummingbird mecha suits.] man the assembly line!",11,4,50
Zhu Li,"[Grabs Varrick by the shoulder and turns him around to face her.] No! I am not your assistant anymore. [Points at Varrick, who bends backward.] If you want me around, you need to start treating me like an equal!",11,4,50
,"She walks off, leaving Varrick standing bent backward, while Bolin stands by in silence. When Varrick straightens up and shrugs, Bolin smacks his own forehead. Cut to a radio operating room, with a close-up of a switchboard. An operator plugs in one of the cables into another line.",11,4,50
Radio operator,"[Voice-over.] We're patched into the emergency broadcast line. [Cut to a back-view of Mako, Lin, Wu, and the operator herself.] You're going out to every radio in the city.",11,4,50
Mako,"[Speaking into a microphone.] Attention citizens of Republic City. This is not a test. [Cut to a side-shot of the foursome.] An attack on our city is imminent. President Raiko has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all citizens. Please find [He starts to flip pages in search of a specific section in a book in front of him.] your evacuation handbooks and turn to [A phone rings.] subsection one-dash-two-six. [More phones ring. Cut to a overview side-shot of the entire room. More and more lights on the switchboard start to light up.] There you will find initial instructions for your area. For example, if you live in northwest vector one, report to your primary meeting location, [Lin takes note of the increasing phone activity.] which would be at the eastern entrance of the Southern Water Tribe library. [Cut to a close-up of Lin and Wu, as the former looks around, taking in the chaos that is enfolding.] There, you would choose a leader as specified in section one-dash-two-eight. [Lin grits her teeth and rests her forehead on her hand.]",11,4,50
Radio operator,"[Voice-over.] Uh, Chief, [Cut to the back-shot of the foursome.] we're getting confused calls from all over the city. I think Mako's starting a panic.",11,4,50
Mako,What's confusing? [Turns over his shoulder to face Lin.] I'm giving very specific instructions.,11,4,50
Lin,"[Averts her head; annoyed.] Great, this is just what we need.",11,4,50
Wu,"I got this. [Mako stands up to make room for Wu.] Hello, everyone, this is Prince Wu. Now, I know you're all a little scared. Believe me, I know what it's like to be afraid. I used to not be able to go to the bathroom by myself. But if we let that fear control us [Cut to city, where the people are listening to Wu's message via loudspeakers and radios.] none of us will ever be able to go to the bathroom and then we all lose. [Cut to citizens sitting by a small radio.] But the people of Republic City aren't losers, we're winners. [Citizens brighten.] Winners that are going to [Cut to Narook's Seaweed Noodlery where Tahno, Ming, and their fangirls are eating.] get out of this city in a calm and orderly fashion. [Cut back to Wu.] So I want you to grab your family, grab your neighbor [Cut to a park, where Gommu is listening to the broadcast via a radio while eating fish; a police officer walks up behind him.] grab that guy down the street you don't know very well and head to the nearest bus, [Gommu grabs the police officer and drags him off.] train or ferry station. [Cut back to Wu.] We're going to get you out of here, safe and sound.",11,4,50
,"Cut to Lin and Mako, whose serious expressions turn to one of astonishment as the royal finishes. Cut to a wider shot of the switchboard, where the lights of incoming calls are quickly all disappearing, much to everyone's pleasure.",11,4,50
Lin,"[Frontal shot of Lin, Wu, and Mako.] Good job, kid. [Turns to Wu.] You might not make such a bad king after all.",11,4,50
,"Wu looks at her, though when Mako places a hand on his shoulder, he turns to look at his bodyguard with a proud expression. Cut to Air Temple Island where Tenzin opens a door and walks into a room.",11,4,50
Tenzin,"Rohan's with the Acolytes. They have the boat ready to leave. [Move back to show the rest of the room, where Pema, Ikki, Jinora, and Meelo are gathered, their suitcase empty.] Why aren't you all packed yet?",11,4,50
Pema,[Frontal shot.] The kids and I have been talking and we decided we want to stay. This is our city and it's going to need all the help it can get.,11,4,50
Meelo,[Side-shot as Tenzin walks up to his family.] Yeah! Only a coward flees his fate.,11,4,50
Tenzin,"[Embracing his family.] Thank you. [Releasing them; to Pema.] I'm sure Prince Wu could use your help with the evacuation. [Turns to Meelo, Ikki, and Jinora.] And you three can help the other airbenders keep an eye on the Earth Empire troops from above.",11,4,50
Meelo,[Frontal shot of Meelo and Jinora. He raises a clenched fist.] Kuvira's gonna rue the day she messed with [Knocks himself on the chest once.] Meelo.,11,4,50
,"Jinora glances off to the side at this statement. Cut to the outside of Republic City station. Satomobiles are scattered everywhere and airships fly above. Transition inside to a long line of evacuees waiting to board the trains. Fade to Wu and Pema directing evacuees. Cut to Yue Bay at nighttime, where the United Forces Navy and several airships are approaching Republic City. Cut to an overview of the bay and the city. Switch to a side-shot of General Iroh standing at the bow of a battleship. Cut to another aerial shot of the city and the incoming United Forces Army. The night shot transitions to daytime and the troops have scattered across the bay and city. Several shots transition between night and day to show the emptying of the city. Cut to a side-shot of a group of advancing mecha tanks who take up positions in front the gathered battalions of infantry troops at the outskirts of the city, the rising sun in their back. Several lines of barbed wire are positioned in front of the assembled troops. Cut to Air Temple Island, to the base of the tower; the shot pans up.",11,4,50
Raiko,[Voice-over.] I still don't like having to abandon my office in the city.,11,4,50
,"Cut to inside the tower, where Raiko is looking out of a window, though now glances over his shoulder to Tenzin and Lin.",11,4,50
Lin,Air Temple Island is the ideal location for your base of operations and you'll be safe here.,11,4,50
Korra,"[Camera pans to the right to show Korra, Bolin, Asami, and Mako ascending the stairs.] There's something we need to discuss with you.",11,4,50
Tenzin,What is it?,11,4,50
Korra,[Side-shot as they walk up to the threesome.] The four of us have been talking and ... we wanna take out Kuvira's spirit weapon before it gets too close to the city.,11,4,50
Tenzin,[Frontal shot of the threesome.] That sounds like a risk we don't need to take. The evacuation is on schedule and General Iroh is getting his army in place.,11,4,50
Korra,"[Frontal shot of Team Avatar.] I know Iroh can go toe-to-toe with Kuvira's army, but that weapon ...",11,4,50
Bolin,It's too powerful! It can destroy the city.,11,4,50
Mako,We can't let it get to our doorstep.,11,4,50
Korra,We'll sneak behind enemy lines and disable the weapon.,11,4,50
Asami,"If it works, it'll even the playing field.",11,4,50
Tenzin,But if you get caught ...,11,4,50
Korra,It's worth the risk.,11,4,50
Raiko,"[Cut to a back-shot of Korra's head, showing Lin and Tenzin as well; camera pans to the left to reveal Raiko as well as he speaks.] I agree, and it might be our only shot at preventing an all-out war. [Nodding toward Korra.] Good luck.",11,4,50
Korra,[Close-up of Korra's face.] We'll head out tonight.,11,4,50
,"The scene cuts to a military outpost somewhere in the mountains at night, light emanating from the guard towers. A road, also electrically lit, winds around the side of the mountain. The shot changes to the perspective of a guard peering into the fog with binoculars. As he looks, a faint crash sounds in the distance and the camera moves back toward the source of the sound and movement can be seen. Switch to a frontal shot of two guards, with one looking through binoculars.",11,4,50
Sentry,There's something out there!,11,4,50
,"The other sentry peers through his own pair of binoculars. Cut to a shot of the fog, though as a breeze blows it aside, a multitude of mecha suits and other tanks of Kuvira's army are revealed to be marching steadily through the fog.",11,4,50
Sentry,[Shocked; voice-over.] It's Kuvira's army! [Cut to a side-shot of the sentries as they lower their binoculars.] They're a week early! Get the commander immediately and radio Republic City!,11,4,50
,"As the second guard turns to execute the orders, he is halted when a loud crash is heard and the ground shakes. He turns toward the sound and the view cuts to the incoming army, though now the legs of an enormous mecha suit are visible behind the tanks, dwarfing them in comparison. The shot pans up to reveal the upper body of the humanoid colossus as it raises its arms, accompanied by a loud sound of mechanical equipment, and prepares the spirit energy cannon attached to its right arm. As the tip of the barrel starts to glow purple, the shot cuts back to the a side-view of the shocked sentries. Cut to a far off shot of the enormous mecha suit as the energy beam is fired. Cut to a side-shot of the outpost as the purple beam of energy hits it directly and is hidden from view by a flash of brilliant white light. When the light fades, the outpost is in rubbles and burning. Cut to the colossal mecha suit as it lowers its arms, flames licking the air in the foreground. Cut to morning in the mountains. A flying bison soars through the air, groaning. Cut to its saddle, where Bolin is peering through a telescope, while Asami and Mako are surveying their surroundings with the naked eye. As Bolin directs his attention to his left, he gasps in surprise, drawing everyone's attention.",11,4,50
Bolin,Guys! I see something. [Points.] Down there! [Cut to a shot of Kuvira's tanks crossing the landscape.],11,4,50
Asami,Is that – ?,11,4,50
Korra,Kuvira. [Cut to the group as they survey the approaching tanks.] She's already crossed into United Republic territory. She's a week early.,11,4,50
Mako,"This doesn't make sense. [Cut to a close-up of Bolin and Mako.] There aren't any train tracks this way. How are they transporting that super weapon of theirs? [They hear thudding sounds, as the enormous mecha passes by.]",11,4,50
Asami,Apparently on a giant mecha suit!,11,4,50
,"Cut to the legs of the mecha, as each step causes a large dust cloud to blow up around its feet. Pan up to the body of the mecha, several airships visible in the background. The view cuts back to Team Avatar as they look upon the giant mecha in wonder.",11,4,50
Mako,[To Bolin.] Did you know Kuvira was building that thing?,11,4,50
Bolin,"[Sarcastically.] Oh, did I forget to mention it? No, of course I didn't know!",11,4,50
,Cut to the inside of the mecha suit; Kuvira stands within.,11,4,50
Mecha operator,There's a flying bison up ahead.,11,4,50
Kuvira,The Avatar. [Begins controlling the mecha with her metalbending. She raises the spirit weapon and points it at the bison. A purple glow begins to form at the end of the turret.],11,4,50
Bolin,"[Cut back to Team Avatar.] I know what happens next! We gotta get out of here, now! Now! [The mecha fires a beam of energy that glances the bison, knocking it off-course. The bison manages to stabilize itself. Cut back to the interior of the mecha, where Kuvira fires another blast. It misses but blasts through a nearby mountain.]",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,Should we go after them? They're going to warn Republic City.,11,4,50
Kuvira,[Smiling; cut to a close-up of her face.] Let them. No one can stop us.,11,4,50
,"Cut to Air Temple Island, as Team Avatar's bison comes in to land; Tenzin, Pema, Raiko, Lin, Suyin, Wei, and Wing gather to meet Team Avatar, who dismount from their bison.",11,4,50
Tenzin,Korra? Are you all right? Why are you back so soon?,11,4,50
Korra,It's Kuvira. Our intel was wrong. She must have known Zhu Li had the information.,11,4,50
Raiko,What are you trying to say?,11,4,50
Korra,Kuvira's army is only a few hours away.,11,4,50
Tenzin,"No, they can't be! We're not ready.",11,4,50
Korra,And that spirit weapon of hers is attached to a giant mecha suit. It's over twenty-five stories tall!,11,4,50
Raiko,[Turns to Lin.] Get General Iroh on the line and tell him that the attack is happening today. We need to lock down the city. [Lin hurries off.],11,4,50
Tenzin,"Pema! Find Wu and get the remaining citizens to safety, immediately. [Pema walks off.] We can't have innocent lives in jeopardy.",11,4,50
Bolin,What should we do?,11,4,50
Asami,Let's go to my factory. Maybe we can get a few of those hummingbird suits up and running.,11,4,50
Suyin,We're coming with you. [Asami nods in agreement.],11,4,50
Korra,I'll head to the front lines and help General Iroh.,11,4,50
,"Cut to a distant shot of the city from the air, followed by a shot of a number of airbenders mounting buildings in preparation for the attack. In a zoom on the top of one of the buildings, Kai, Jinora, Tenzin, Meelo, Ikki, and Bumi, along with another airbender, are seen staring into the distance. Another switch of shot shows a birds-eye view from above the buildings looking out onto the field where the army waits for Kuvira's arrival. Cut to a rotating still of Wu in the train station, directing people; another shot shows Wu and Pema as a crowd of people pours past them onto a waiting train; yet another set of shots shows Lin and Raiko in his new office on Air Temple Island, as they stare out the window at the city in the distance. Cut to the field of fortification. Three fences of tank traps and barbed wire stretch across the shot as the army waits behind it. A quick cut to General Iroh and Korra standing together in silence is accompanied by a distant crash. The shot cuts out to an aerial shot facing toward the mountains as more crashes are heard in the distance. Suddenly the shot zooms wildly on the colossal mecha as it emerges from behind a hill. After another close-up shot of the mecha, the shot cuts to its cockpit, where a determined-looking Kuvira stands, staring unblinkingly at her objective. Two separate shots show the shock and disbelief on the faces of the airbenders, Lin, and Raiko. The mecha comes to a stop just in front of the barbed-wire fencing; a distant shot shows the mecha towering over its opponents, an airship floating just behind it. Quick cut to Iroh and Korra; Iroh, like the others, looks shocked, while Korra simply looks defiant. Cut to Raiko's office as he tunes a radio to a proper frequency and speaks into the microphone at his desk.",11,4,50
Raiko,"Kuvira, this is President Raiko. I order you to stand down. Turn your army around and leave.",11,4,50
Kuvira,[As the shot cuts to her.] You're in no position to give orders.,11,4,50
Raiko,"[Through the speaker.] Stand down, or we will attack!",11,4,50
Kuvira,"I don't think you understand the power I possess. [As the shot cuts to Korra and Iroh, her voice continues to emanate from a radio on a table.] Let me make it clear.",11,4,50
,"Cut to the interior of the weapon as a vine sample loads into the firing chamber; the arms of the mecha raise into the firing position, and the cannon fires. The beam of energy sails over the city, colliding with a warship in the harbor, which immediately explodes into flame. Another blast from the weapon catches two more warships, which also become engulfed in flames. The shot cuts to Varrick's factory; inside, Mako, Bolin, Asami, Zhu Li, and Varrick watch as the weapon destroys two more warships. Varrick yells out, angry.",11,4,50
Varrick,[Gesturing toward the burning wrecks in the harbor.] This is exactly why I didn't wanna build that weapon!,11,4,50
,"Cut to the battlefield; as smoke rises behind them, Korra and Iroh gaze fearfully at the mecha, which proceeds to turn its cannon downward, toward the army assembled on the field. The men assembled take a few steps back, fearful as well. After a quick shot of Korra and Iroh, a succession of shots shows the burning, sinking ships in the harbor and the airbenders on board trying to lift the crew to safety. Cut back to Raiko, who stares at the burning ships, a terrified uncertainty on his face. Iroh calls through the radio.",11,4,50
Iroh,"[Urgently.] Mister President, do I have your order to engage?",11,4,50
Kuvira,[Also through the radio.] You have three seconds before I wipe out your army.,11,4,50
,"Raiko snatches up the microphone, addressing Lin briefly.",11,4,50
Raiko,I have no choice.,11,4,50
Kuvira,[Through radio.] Time's up!,11,4,50
Raiko,Stop! We surrender. Republic City is yours.,11,4,50
,"Cut to the mecha's cockpit, as Kuvira straightens up from her battle stance.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"Good. Turn your army and the Avatar over to me, and give Baatar your location. [Cut to Iroh and Korra.] He'll present you with our terms.",11,4,50
Korra,"[As Iroh smashes the handheld microphone down onto its receiver, furious.] I'm not surrendering!",11,4,50
Iroh,"Get back to the city before she sees you. And Korra -- [She turns back around, stopping at the exit of the tent.] --find a way to beat that thing.",11,4,50
Korra,[Determined.] I will.,11,4,50
,The next shot shows Korra running through the empty camp toward the city and the columns of black smoke rising high into the air beyond. Cut to Kuvira's cockpit as Baatar's voice speaks over the radio.,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"We've done it, Kuvira. [Cut to him, on his airship.] And I just got word that President Raiko is on Air Temple Island. I'm heading there now.",11,4,50
,"Cut to the crew in Varrick's warehouse. As the others stand in groups, Korra walks through the double doors.",11,4,50
Korra,Raiko surrendered. [Zoom on her face.] It's down to us now.,11,4,50
Bolin,"[Looking exasperated and terrified as he speaks.] How are we supposed to fight an entire army, a mecha giant, and that crazy weapon?",11,4,50
Asami,"We can't fight it, but maybe we can cripple it. [Turns to Zhu Li.] Zhu Li, when you were spying on Kuvira, did you learn anything about that metal monster?",11,4,50
Zhu Li,I had no idea they were even building it.,11,4,50
Varrick,Guess Baatar Jr. is a better inventor than I thought. [Aggravated.] Don't tell him I said that.,11,4,50
Korra,"[Optimistic.] That's it! Baatar Jr. built it, he'll know how to take it down! I say we capture him, and get him to talk.",11,4,50
Tenzin,Hmm ...,11,4,50
Korra,"[She hears Tenzin's reservations.] I know it's a long shot, but it's the only chance we have, and if we don't ...",11,4,50
Tenzin,"[Interrupting Korra, his tone decisive.] Korra, I'm in.",11,4,50
Korra,"We'll need a stealth team of airbenders to get in and out of Baatar's airship unnoticed. Tenzin, Bumi, Jinora, Kai, let's get moving.",11,4,50
Meelo,"[Noticing he was left off the list, disappointed.] What about me?",11,4,50
Korra,"[Kneeling down to talk to him.] Sorry, buddy. This mission counts on everyone being as silent as possible - [Smiling.] - and your farts are just too much of a wild card.",11,4,50
Meelo,"[Angry.] I can be quiet! [Farts loudly and blushes.] Okay, point taken.",11,4,50
,"Cut to somewhere over Republic City, where Baatar Jr.'s airship is flying toward Air Temple Island, on its way to met Raiko. As the shot switches to an overhead view, a sky bison flies into the frame, high above the airship below. A close-up shows the five people in its saddle: Korra, Tenzin, Kai, Jinora, and Bumi. Korra turns to the airbenders.",11,4,50
Korra,Is everyone ready?,11,4,50
,"The airbenders all nod their heads. Korra rises to her feet and jumps over the side of the saddle with her glider in hand, the airbenders following her one by one. The frame switches to show them gliding swiftly downward through the air toward the airship. Korra runs up to the hatch leading to the airship's interior as they land, using metalbending to destroy the latch and flipping the hatch open. She silently motions for Bumi and Tenzin to drop in, and Korra follows them through the open hatch, leaving Kai and Jinora to keep watch on the top of the airship. Cut to the interior, where a guard walks down a deserted hallway within the airship. As he passes a empty doorway filled with red light, Korra pokes her head around the threshold and, after a few seconds, motions for the two airbenders to follow her again. The shot shows the three of them tiptoeing down another deserted corridor before coming to a stop at a corner. On the other side is Baatar Jr., inputting a passcode into a security door. The doors open and Baatar walks through; as the doors close, Korra jumps from her cover, metalbending the doors into an open position. As Tenzin and Bumi rush into the room, Baatar's shocked yell can be heard offscreen. There is a noise of Baatar struggling vainly to escape before he is slammed into a thick glass window with a gag over his mouth. Korra and Tenzin hold him in place as Bumi pulls a large sack over his body. The next shot, at the top of the airship, shows the sack containing Baatar Jr. being airbent out of the small hatch, making desperate noises behind his gag; Kai and Jinora catch him as the other climb out of the airship. The final shot of the capture shows Tenzin and Bumi carrying Baatar Jr. between themselves, gliding back toward the city as Kai, Jinora and Korra follow behind. Cut to Varrick's warehouse; after a brief exterior shot, the scene cuts inside, where a gagged Baatar Jr. sits regarding his captors with a glare of utter, burning dislike. Korra walks over to him and removes his gag; he gasps for air for a moment before speaking.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"You've made a terrible mistake. [Cut to a shot facing the group, at Baatar's back.] Once Kuvira finds out I'm missing, you're all done for.",11,4,50
Korra,"That's why, before she finds out, you're going to tell us how to stop that mecha giant, or else.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,Or else what?,11,4,50
,"The shot cuts to a close-up of Korra's face. As she looks at Baatar Jr., her eyes flare with the bright blueish-white light of the Avatar State, and she advances on Baatar, grasping him by his bonds and lifting him into the air with one arm. For a moment, he groans and tries to escape, but he regains his composure and looks confidently right back into the glowing eyes.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,[Smiling.] You won't hurt me. I know an empty threat when I see one.,11,4,50
,"Cut to Korra's face; after a moment, her eyes fade back to normal as she leaves the Avatar State. Exasperated and angry, she lets Baatar fall back to the floor; he groans as he crashes down before speaking to the group.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"Was this your best idea? [He laughs to himself.] You've lost, only you haven't accepted it yet.",11,4,50
,"Cut to Suyin, walking over to Korra.",11,4,50
Suyin,Let me talk to him.,11,4,50
,"Korra steps back, giving Suyin to floor. As she walks toward her son, the scene cuts to Air Temple Island, where Baatar's airship pulls up next to the central tower. A shot from Raiko's office shows the airship lowering itself to the level of the open floor-to-ceiling window as Raiko, Lin and a few guards stand waiting. Two doors on the side of the airship slide open, revealing two soldiers on the other side; as a metal walkway extends outwards and downwards toward the president and the chief, they step onto it, letting it take them down toward the conquered leaders. The walkway hits the stone floor of the office, coming to a stop. Raiko, Lin, and the soldiers stand waiting for Baatar to emerge. A few seconds pass in silence; the soldiers turn to peer toward the empty doorway after a moment before turning back around to face Raiko and Lin. A third soldier comes running hurriedly down the walkway, and the two other soldiers have a quick, hushed discussion.",11,4,50
Soldier #1,Are you sure?,11,4,50
Soldier #2,Check the engine room.,11,4,50
Raiko,[Interrupting them.] What's going on? Is everything all right?,11,4,50
Soldier #3,"[Holding up a hand.] Just a minute, sir. [To the other soldiers, hushed again.] I'm telling you, I looked everywhere.",11,4,50
Lin,"[Fed up, yelling.] All right, enough whispering!",11,4,50
Raiko,I'm ready to discuss the terms of the surrender with Baatar Jr. Where is he?,11,4,50
Soldier #3,Uh ... I'm not really sure.,11,4,50
,"Upon hearing this, Lin and Raiko give each other looks of grave uncertainty. Cut to the warehouse, where Suyin kneels in front of her son.",11,4,50
Suyin,Baatar --,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"If you think I'm going to spill all my secrets to you, Mother, you're sadly mistaken.",11,4,50
Suyin,"Why are you doing this? I know you set out to help better the world, but this is madness!",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"It's madness to let others take what's yours and accept it blindly! The United Republic belongs to us, and we're taking it back.",11,4,50
Suyin,But at what cost? How many people have to lose their lives before Kuvira is satisfied?,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,[Leaning forward against his bonds.] It doesn't have to cost any lives if you would all just surrender! All that Kuvira and I want is a united Earth Empire!,11,4,50
Suyin,"[As Baatar leans back.] I don't know what I did to hurt you, but whatever it was, I'm sorry. When you left Zaofu, it broke my heart -- [Quick cut to Wei, Wing, and Opal, who look mildly unhappy.] -- and our family has never been the same since. Please, Baatar -- stop all this and come home. [Cut to Baatar, not looking at his mother.] We want you back with us.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"[Turning his head back to Suyin, his expression forceful.] Kuvira is my family now.",11,4,50
,"Suyin closes her eyes, and tears run down her face. The shot cuts to Tenzin, Bumi, and Korra, who have been watching Suyin and Baatar's conversation. Korra turns her head to Tenzin.",11,4,50
Korra,"We've been going about his all wrong. [Walking over to Baatar again as Suyin walks away.] You're right. I'm not gonna physically hurt you if you don't talk. But there is something I could do that will be even more painful. [She bends over, looking right into his eyes.] I will take away the one thing you care for the most ... Kuvira.",11,4,50
,"The angry expression on Baatar's face instantly evaporates into shock, but he collects himself again.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,What do you mean?,11,4,50
Korra,"Kuvira might win. She might chase us out of the city. But you won't be around to enjoy the victory. Because wherever I run, I'll take you. I am going to make it my life's mission to never let you see the one you love again. [Straightening up, now staring down at him.] Is taking the city worth losing Kuvira forever?",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,[Suddenly desperate.] No! You can't!,11,4,50
Korra,I will ... unless you convince Kuvira to back off. You two will still have the Earth Empire. Just leave the United Republic alone.,11,4,50
,"Cut to Baatar's face, overflowing with shock and disbelief. The scene switches back to the confusion on Air Temple Island. Both groups are standing idly, waiting for Baatar to show himself. Raiko checks his watch. From on board the airship, another soldier appears, holding a two-way radio.",11,4,50
Soldier #4,It's Kuvira. She wants to talk to Baatar. What should I tell her?,11,4,50
,"In unison, the soldiers' heads all turn toward Raiko and Lin. Raiko, out of patience, steps forward.",11,4,50
Raiko,"For goodness' sake, give me that radio! Let me talk to her.",11,4,50
,"The soldier with the radio complies, stepping down the walkway and giving Raiko the radio. He speaks into it.",11,4,50
Raiko,"Kuvira, this is Raiko. What kind of game are you playing? You told me you would send Baatar over with your terms, and then he doesn't show.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"[Over radio.] What do you mean, ""he didn't show""?",11,4,50
Raiko,"According to your people, he's not on the airship.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"[As the shot cuts to her in the cockpit.] If he's not on the airship, then where is he?",11,4,50
,A brief burst of static interrupts the conversation. Baatar Jr.'s voice fills the cockpit.,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"[Over radio.] Kuvira? It's Baatar. [Cut to the warehouse, where Korra holds the radio up to Baatar's head.] I've been captured. My airship was ambushed and I was taken by force. Korra refuses to release me unless we back down and leave the city.",11,4,50
Kuvira,[As the scene cuts back to her.] Are you injured?,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,[Over radio.] I'm fine.,11,4,50
Kuvira,Is the Avatar there with you now?,11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"Yes, everyone is here.",11,4,50
,"Kuvira metalbends a switch on her control panel, disallowing her voice to be heard over the other end of the line. She turns to an operator on her left.",11,4,50
Kuvira,Find out where that signal's coming from.,11,4,50
,"As the operator goes to work, Baatar's voice comes through again.",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"Listen to me. [Cut to a close-up of his face.] If you try to take Republic City, the Avatar will never let me see you again ... and I refuse to live that way. [Cut to Kuvira, listening carefully to Baatar Jr.'s words.] Forget the United Republic; we have our empire! We have each other! [Cut back to Baatar Jr., as a shadow of happiness and hope flits across his face.] Let's go back home and get married. The only thing that matters is that we're together for the rest of our lives.",11,4,50
,Cut back to the cockpit. The operator turns his masked face to Kuvira.,11,4,50
Mecha operator,We've identified their position.,11,4,50
,"Kuvira flips the switch back up and talks, her voice thick with emotion.",11,4,50
Kuvira,"You're right. This city isn't worth sacrificing our life together. [She shuts her eyes; the view cuts to a spot behind Kuvira, facing out on the city before her.] I love you, Baatar.",11,4,50
,"Cut to the warehouse, where Korra releases Baatar from his bonds.",11,4,50
Korra,"As soon as we work out terms with Kuvira, we'll let you out of here.",11,4,50
,"The shot zooms to the window on the right, as Mako stands next to it. Through it, in the distance, the colossal mecha can be seen, moving. A cut to the thing itself shows its arms rising upwards, the left steadying the right as the massive barrel swings upward into place. The mecha suit is entering the incipient phases of its firing sequence. Mako turns his head to look out the window. His eyes widen as he realizes what is about to happen.",11,4,50
Mako,"[Reeling backward, pointing at the towering mecha suit.] Guys! She must have our location! She's pointing that weapon right at us!",11,4,50
Baatar Jr.,"[As the shot cuts to a close-up of himself and Bolin, terrified.] No! She wouldn't!",11,4,50
,"Cut to the barrel of the weapon, the telltale purplish glow rising deep within it. Quick zoom back to the warehouse as Korra whirls around, terror and panic on her face.",11,4,50
Korra,Everyone out! Now! Now!,11,4,50
,"With a flicker and a ear-splitting boom, the cannon fires, the ray of purple energy screaming across the water of the bay, vaporizing the water it hits as it rises upward. As the beam tears through the factory, it lays waste to the room where the hummingbird mecha suits sit, destroying them in a flash of light and a crushing explosion. Cut to the people within, fleeing as the beam blasts through the room. It passes behind them and the room instantaneously detonates, a blinding fireball rising from the floor beneath and throwing the helpless men and women off their feet into a cloud of dust. They disappear from view as the shot cuts to the outside. The ray of energy dies and the warehouse lies in a smoking, ruinous heap, the water flowing toward the ruined structure through a channel carved into the ground by the beam. Cut to Air Temple Island, where a billowing column of black smoke rises into the air, easily visible in the distance. The low rumble of the massive explosion rolls across the bay. Cut to Raiko and Lin as Raiko drops a pair of binoculars from his eyes.",11,4,50
Raiko,[Stunned.] No!,11,4,50
Lin,[Turning to Officer Song on her left.] Keep the president safe! I'm going to check for survivors.,11,4,50
,"She jumps from the balcony, the sound of her bending her cables can be heard offscreen. Cut to the mecha lowering its arms, followed by Kuvira in the cockpit. She breathes in, her head turned away from the shot and her eyes closed for a moment as she fights back emotion, and exhales, dropping her head. Her face void of emotion once more and filled with a disassociated resolve, Kuvira raises her eyes to the city beyond.",11,4,50
,Roll credits.,11,4,50
,"The scene opens on a massive heap of rubble, what remains of the Future Industries warehouse after its impact with the energy cannon. As ash rains down through the air and smoke rises into the sky, a large slab of concrete begins to quiver and shake; the higher end of the slab rises into the air, revealing Bolin straining to bend it upward beneath it. The other people trapped by the explosion escape as he keeps the wall at bay.",12,4,51
Bolin,"[His voice strained with exertion as people rush past him.] Go ahead, take your time, just bending a giant wall! Man, have we got a lot of people hurt! [As Bumi and Suyin carefully and slowly carry out an unconscious Baatar Jr.] Is that everybody?! Gah!",12,4,51
,"Bolin drops the huge slab of concrete, throwing himself out of its way as it crashes back down. Cut to Tenzin as he airbends himself up to the top of a building and rushes to its edge; the view pans right as Tenzin uses it as a vantage point, showing the giant mecha wading through the bay and, to its right, a battalion of normal-sized mecha suits marching across the bay on a bridge. After a quick cut to the horde of mecha suits, the shot returns to Tenzin as he stares in horror at the oncoming horde, before running from his vantage and returning to the others, landing in the middle of the group gathered in a crater of rubble nearby.",12,4,51
Tenzin,"[Urgent.] Kuvira is heading our way, with a platoon of mecha suits!",12,4,51
Asami,What should we do?,12,4,51
Bolin,"This is my hometown and I hate to say it, but there's no use risking all our lives to fight that giant thing! Let her take the city for now! We'll think of some way to come back and beat her!",12,4,51
Mako,"What about all the people who haven't been evacuated yet? If Kuvira finds out that Wu is with them, she might fire that spirit cannon at him and take them all out.",12,4,51
,"As Mako speaks, the shot pans right to show Suyin, the still-unconscious Baatar Jr., Wei, Wing, and Korra. when Korra speaks, all their eyes turn to her.",12,4,51
Korra,I couldn't stop Kuvira from taking Zaofu. I'm not letting her conquer Republic City. The world isn't safe as long as she has that weapon.,12,4,51
,"A firm, driven voice suddenly speaks from the top of the rubble crater on Korra's left and the members of the group all turn to see Lin standing atop it.",12,4,51
Lin,I agree. We take down that giant today.,12,4,51
Korra,Lin!,12,4,51
Lin,[Smiling.] Glad to see you all made it out. You had me worried.,12,4,51
Varrick,"Well, you benders are going to have to fight her alone. She just blew up our factory with all our hummingbird suits.",12,4,51
Asami,"Not all of them. There are the prototypes back at my office. If we can get those ready to fly, we'll at least be able to offer a little air support.",12,4,51
Korra,"Su, you take Baatar Jr. and the rest of the wounded back to Asami's office. Get those suits working as soon as you can. The rest of us will just have to face Kuvira on our own.",12,4,51
,"Cut to the train station, where a tremor causes debris to rain down from the ceiling above. The evacuees gathered begin to panic and Pema climbs onto a bench and yells to the crowd, trying to restore calm.",12,4,51
Pema,"Everyone, please settle down. The trains should be returning to pick us up soon.",12,4,51
Evacuee,[Impatient.] Tell that mecha jerk to settle down. She's the one blowing up the whole city!,12,4,51
Train conductor,"[Inopportunely climbing up onto the bench in front of Pema.] I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I just heard on the radio that Kuvira's army has destroyed the train tracks. We're not getting out of the city by rail.",12,4,51
Tu,"[Jumping up onto the bench behind Pema, pinning her between himself and the conductor; his voice is frantic.] Everyone! I was just up on the observation deck and saw a bunch of mecha suit soldiers heading this way!",12,4,51
Evacuee,Oh great! The giant one wasn't enough?! It's over! We're all gonna get blown to bits!,12,4,51
,"Wu jumps onto the bench behind the conductor; the excess of people standing on the small bench causes Tu, on the opposite side, to nearly lose his balance.",12,4,51
Wu,"Listen everyone, I can get us out of here if you just sit tight. [Cordially, to the conductor.] Can you step off the bench, please? It's a little crowded up here.",12,4,51
Train conductor,"[Stepping off the bench, muttering.] Sure. I'm only the conductor. No one needs me on the bench.",12,4,51
Wu,Just stay calm. I'll be right back. [To Tu who follows.] Come on.,12,4,51
Evacuee,"[Suddenly speaking up; Wu stops to listen and is run into by Tu, nearly pushed off the bench.] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?",12,4,51
Wu,"[Regaining his balance, annoyed.] I'm going to get some help. [To Pema.] You think you can handle this unruly mob for a little while?",12,4,51
Pema,[Confidently.] I raised Meelo. I can handle anything.,12,4,51
,"Cut to a deserted street city street. The only people visible are Korra, Bolin, Mako, Lin, Ikki, and Meelo as they race down it. The shot cuts to the interior of a paint store, looking out through the front glass window, as the group runs past. Meelo, the last to run by, suddenly stops and returns to the window.",12,4,51
Meelo,A paint store? That's it! [He airbends the door down.],12,4,51
Lin,"[Returning to get him.] What are you doing, Meelo?",12,4,51
Meelo,"[Brightly.] I just got an idea how to beat the giant. Now, everyone, grab some paint and find me some balloons!",12,4,51
,"Cut to a wide shot of some of the city's buildings. The mecha suit's crashing can be heard in the background as the shot pans up to reveal the mecha suit itself walking through the streets. Cut to a driven-looking Kuvira in the cockpit, followed by a nearby rooftop, where the feet of many airbenders run across its surface and throw themselves into the empty air beyond, taking flight with bright-green balloons filled with paint strapped to their bodies. They arrange themselves in formation and and bear down on the mecha suit. Cut to a shot, seen as though through binoculars, of the oncoming airbenders, before switching to Kuvira's soldier observing the scenario in that manner from the cockpit.",12,4,51
Soldier,Airbenders approaching.,12,4,51
Kuvira,I see them.,12,4,51
,"Manipulating the controls, Kuvira turns the mecha suit to face the airbenders and points the cannon toward them. Taking careful aim, she fires the weapon, scattering the airbenders as the beam passes them by and impacts a building beyond, causing an explosion which pierces a hole through it and severs the top from the bottom. The airbenders fall out of the sky, landing on rooftops before taking flight again. As the airbenders swarm around the mecha suit, it flails its non-weaponized arm in an attempt to swat the airbenders away. Pan to the ground where Lin, Wei, Wing, Mako and Bolin stare up at the mecha suit, large spools of wire at the ready. Cut to Meelo who dodges a swat from the arm before landing on the outstretched arm and running across the body, airbending the balloons from his suit and holding them in midair, spinning them around his head.",12,4,51
Meelo,Bombs away!,12,4,51
,"Meelo throws his balloons to the mecha suit's target crosshair, covering it with purple paint. The airbenders follow suit and cover the remaining windows. In front of the unmoving mecha, Korra airbends herself onto the roof; the shot cuts briefly to her as she stands there, glaring at the massive machine in front of her with disdain. Cut to an outside view of the cockpit, airbenders still swarming around it, followed by the interior of the cockpit itself as Kuvira's vision becomes almost completely obscured by the paint.",12,4,51
Kuvira,Clear the glass!,12,4,51
,"On the outside, nozzles spray water on the windows. Cut to Tenzin as he lands on a nearby tile roof, taking cover and yelling to the others.",12,4,51
Tenzin,Now!,12,4,51
,Lin swings onto the mecha suit's right ankle and tries to metalbend the joints. The endeavor is unsuccessful and she yells back to Bolin as he stands with the spools of wire nearby.,12,4,51
Lin,"The joints are platinum, too! We can't metalbend any of it!",12,4,51
,"As Lin and the twins dismount from the mecha suit, Bolin advances on it, catapulting himself into the air.",12,4,51
Bolin,"You're about to get the world's largest hot foot, metal lady!",12,4,51
,"Landing in front of the mecha suit's left foot, he lavabends the street beneath it. He spreads the lava until the entire space under the foot is lava, causing the mecha suit's foot to sink into it and become unstable. Cut to the mecha suit's interior as Kuvira loses her balance. Cut to the outside as Lin and the twins bend the spools of wire, wrapping the legs of the suit in the metal cables.",12,4,51
Bolin,Hit it now!,12,4,51
,"Up on the rooftop, Korra enters the Avatar State, building up her attack before sending a large gust of wind at the mecha suit's chest; the other airbenders join in to assist her. As it starts to topple backward, Kuvira struggles to regain the mecha suit's balance and fires the cannon aimlessly, trying to strike the airbenders. The weapon's beam swings wildly through the air and, as Korra ducks underneath it, streaks into the distance, slicing a shimmering ribbon of purple across the midsection of the skyline behind her. As Korra spins to her feet and turns to survey the damage, every single one of the impacted skyscrapers detonates explosively, their deafening immolation spreading a massive cloud of fire across the face of the city. As the airbenders continue their efforts to topple the mecha suit, Korra, after seeing the catastrophic damage, turns back to the mecha suit and redoubles her airbending, knocking the mecha suit back. It grasps at the buildings on either side in a last-ditch effort to save itself. The wires around the mecha suit's legs give out and the machine, getting its left foot underneath it, stabilizes itself and pulls itself upright. Not hesitating a moment, Kuvira points the cannon at the building where Korra and the airbenders stand and fires, causing everyone to scatter as the building explodes. Airbenders tumble through the air, screaming. Korra, trying to rise above the beam with airbending, throws herself out of the way with a terrified yell. A long shot of the city shows the beam tearing through more buildings, followed by more explosions in turn. Korra, tumbling downward, slows her descent by grabbing the wall of a building, breaking her fall with earthbending and airbending. She lifts her head and the shot cuts to show injured airbenders scattered in the street. Korra gets up and runs to the injured airbenders as Mako, Bolin and Lin enter the street from a side alley.",12,4,51
Bolin,"[Running toward the unconscious Opal, utterly distraught.] Opal!",12,4,51
,"The group turns as the crashing draws closer. Through the flames rising high at the end of the street looms the mecha suit, which turns to face them once again.",12,4,51
Korra,[Supporting a female airbender.] Everyone retreat! Take the wounded back to Asami's office!,12,4,51
Lin,I'll meet you there! I'm going to see if I can find any help!,12,4,51
,"Kuvira fires the spirit energy cannon at the group. They flee into side alleys as the street behind them goes up in flames and they are enveloped by a cloud of dust and smoke. Cut to Future Industries where Varrick fixes a hummingbird suit, while Asami and Zhu Li take the upper and lower seats, respectively.",12,4,51
Varrick,"All right, let's fire it up again!",12,4,51
,"Asami closes the suit and begins controlling it. The wings begin flapping and the suit takes off, but soon flies about erratically.",12,4,51
Asami,I can't stabilize it! I thought you fixed the hydraulics.,12,4,51
Varrick,I did! Twist harder!,12,4,51
,"Asami soon loses control of the suit, causing it to crash into a pile of boxes. Varrick runs to help his partners, who have dismounted. Daw runs to the group.",12,4,51
Daw,I hope you have something in here that can take out a platoon of mecha suits. Kuvira's troops are headed this way!,12,4,51
Varrick,"[After some pondering.] I know how to take down some mecha suits and it just might take down that giant, too. [To Asami.] Asami, disconnect anything electrical in here until we get back. [Runs out.] Zhu Li, let's go.",12,4,51
,"Cut to the factory's upper floor where Suyin watches Varrick and Zhu Li leave, she walks up to Baatar Jr..",12,4,51
Baatar Jr.,Where am I? Mom?,12,4,51
Suyin,"Just rest, son. I'm here.",12,4,51
Baatar Jr.,"[Remorseful.] Mom, I'm so sorry. I betrayed you, the whole family. I gave my life to Kuvira and she just fired that weapon at me. How could she do that?",12,4,51
Suyin,"I don't know, sweetie. She's a complicated person.",12,4,51
Baatar Jr.,[Sits up.] Wing and Wei will never forgive me. And Opal.,12,4,51
Suyin,"Yeah, they might take some time to come around. But we'll work through it as a family.",12,4,51
,"Cut to a metal tower on the rooftop, where wire spools are lying around.",12,4,51
Zhu Li,"Do you think this plan will actually work, sir?",12,4,51
Varrick,"I know I can stop the mecha suits with an electromagnetic pulse, so it stands to reason that I can stop a giant mecha suit with a giant electromagnetic pulse. [Climbs up the tower and cuts some wires on a stand.] Zhu Li, I've been thinking.",12,4,51
Zhu Li,"You're always thinking, sir.",12,4,51
Varrick,"Yes. But lately, I've been thinking about you. I know we might not make it out of this mess and I feel like there are some things I should tell you.",12,4,51
Zhu Li,[Anticipating.] There are?,12,4,51
Varrick,"I remember when I was a boy, I had an ostrich horse. Named her Mrs. Beaks. [Zhu Li's excitement dies out and she glares at Varrick.] I grew up on a farm. Did I ever tell you that, Zhu Li? This was before the circus people took me away. Anyway, I loved old Mrs. Beaks, but I took her for granted.",12,4,51
Zhu Li,"You'll have to finish your story later. Kuvira's troops are in range. [Grabs the switch.] Okay, I hope this works.",12,4,51
,"Zhu Li flips the switch creating a buzzing sound from the tower, causing Varrick to cover his ears. Far shot of the tower as electromagnetic pulses are emitted. Cut to the mecha suit platoon as they are disabled one by one.",12,4,51
Varrick,"Yes! Dead in their tracks. [Sees the giant mecha suit still moving.] Oh, rats. She's still coming. Zhu Li, do the thing!",12,4,51
Zhu Li,I'm afraid there are no more things to do.,12,4,51
Kuvira,What was that?,12,4,51
Soldier,"An electromagnetic pulse. It shut down the mecha suits, but our power source is fine.",12,4,51
Kuvira,"Locate the source of the pulse. That must be where Varrick is. Third and fourth mech platoons, move in and continue the sweep. Capture anyone left in the city.",12,4,51
,"Cut to Future Industries Tower, followed by the interior of the factory.",12,4,51
Bolin,"Varrick, how come your electro-thingy shut down the small mecha suits but not the big one?",12,4,51
Baatar Jr.,"Because it's powered with spirit vine energy. I'm sorry. I wish I could help you, but it's unstoppable.",12,4,51
Hiroshi,It's not.,12,4,51
Asami,"[Surprised.] Dad? [Pan to Mako, Bolin, and Korra with surprised looks.]",12,4,51
Lin,"I got him out of jail to help. I figured we need all the geniuses we can get our hands on right now. If the prison's still standing after all this is over, we can throw him back in.",12,4,51
Hiroshi,"I know what you all must think of me, but I love Republic City and I would do anything to save her.",12,4,51
Korra,[Skeptically.] You think you know how to defeat this thing?,12,4,51
Hiroshi,"You must act like an infection: break the skin and attack its vital organs, disconnect the heart and the brain and this beast cannot live.",12,4,51
Korra,But how are we supposed to get inside?,12,4,51
Hiroshi,Future Industries has plasma saws for cutting platinum. If we had one on the mecha suit ...,12,4,51
Asami,But the saws are way too big. We'd never get the suits off the ground.,12,4,51
Hiroshi,I think I can add an electrical element to the welding torch on your suit and convert it into a plasma saw. Then we'll just have to land on the giant and cut open a hole big enough for someone to get in.,12,4,51
Asami,Like a metal mosquito.,12,4,51
Varrick,You know what happens to mosquitoes that land on me? I squash 'em!,12,4,51
Korra,We'll have to attack in a swarm to try to keep you guys safe in the hummingbird suits. It looks like they're our only hope.,12,4,51
,"Cut to the train station where the evacuees have become bored, while Pema is singing.",12,4,51
Pema,"Oh, first he ate the fruit, then he ate the leaves. Hungry little lemur, ate up all my trees. [Stops singing.] Okay, great job everybody. Who's got another song for us?",12,4,51
Evacuee,"[Impatient.] We can't just sit around here singing old airbender songs until we're all captured, or worse.",12,4,51
Pema,Should we play the button game? Who has a button?,12,4,51
,"The evacuee glares are Pema while pounding sounds are heard. The evacuees turn to face the sound, where Wu and Tu are each riding a badgermole. The badgermoles stop in front of the evacuees and sniff at them.",12,4,51
Pema,Where do these badgermoles come from?,12,4,51
Wu,"The zoo! Mako always hated my singing, but they love it!",12,4,51
Evacuee,"Well, what are we supposed to do with badgermoles?",12,4,51
Wu,They're the best earthbenders around! We can use them to tunnel out of the city without Kuvira's troops spotting us.,12,4,51
Evacuee,Are you sure this is the best plan? [The spirit cannon is fired near the group.] Let's follow the moles!,12,4,51
Wu,"[Singing.] Badgermoles, digging holes, under Republic City. Got to run away from Kuvira today, although I do still think she's pretty.",12,4,51
,"The badgermoles create a hole beneath the train tracks and walk into the tunnel. Aerial shot of Republic City, which has been largely decimated with fire burning.",12,4,51
Kuvira,"Mech platoons, report.",12,4,51
Third platoon,"[Interior of Kuvira's mecha suit.] Third platoon, no sign of anyone so far.",12,4,51
Fourth platoon,"Fourth platoon, en route to train station.",12,4,51
Soldier,I think we found the source of the electromagnetic pulse: [Zooms in.] Future Industries Tower.,12,4,51
Kuvira,That's the place.,12,4,51
,"Cut to Asami's office where Varrick, Zhu Li, Hiroshi, and Asami work on the hummingbird suits. Daw runs to the group.",12,4,51
Daw,Kuvira is headed our way!,12,4,51
Korra,[To Asami.] How long will it take to get the plasma saws ready?,12,4,51
Asami,Just a few more minutes.,12,4,51
Korra,Get out there as soon as you can.,12,4,51
Baatar Jr.,"If you do manage to get inside, find the engine room. There are two emergency levers. If you switch them off at the same time, you'll cut the power.",12,4,51
Korra,"Thanks. [To group.] We may not be able to beat that thing, but we can slow it down. Let's go!",12,4,51
,"Cut giant mecha suit walking through the streets, where Team Avatar stops and attempts to intercept. The group scatters and Korra rises up on an air spout and enters the Avatar State. The mecha suit fires the cannon at her, forcing Korra to retreat. After outrunning the cannon, Korra lands and bends out large earth slabs before propelling her up with firebending. Upon landing on the roof, she groans and sends the slabs to the mecha suit. The airbenders dismount and swarm to the mecha suit, avoiding its physical attacks, while Korra continues her barrage of earthbending. While the mecha suit readies its weapon, the airbenders swarm down and push the cannon, causing it to fire to the ground and lose its balance, slamming against a building. Cut to the cockpit where Kuvira braces herself before looking at the airbenders flying past the mecha suit, while Meelo is slammed against the window. Kuvira controls the arm and tries to squash Meelo, but he flies off, causing the mecha suit to hit itself. The mecha suit fires the weapon at Meelo and nearly hits Jinora. Tenzin flies off to protect her.",12,4,51

The group groans and push the building toward the mecha suit. Cut to Kuvira who was taken aback as the mecha suit was pinned down by the building.

Wu,"[Singing.] Oh, Yin, you're the sweetest evacuee I've ever known. [Back shot of the evacuees who mostly cover their ears.] And I just want to thank you for being so kind, when I was living in your home.",12,4,51
Earth Empire sergeant,"Halt! [The evacuees turn to see three mecha suits ambushing them.] Turn around slowly and please, stop that singing. You're all Earth Empire prisoners. Come with us and no one will get hurt.",12,4,51
Wu,"You don't need these people. They're just innocent civilians caught in the crossfire, but I'm Prince Wu, rightful leader of the Earth Kingdom. [Outstretches his hands.] Take me to Kuvira. I've got business with her.",12,4,51

Lin catches the twins, while her sister bends a tent to protect them from debris. Cut to Korra watching the airbenders swarming the giant. Upon hearing buzzing sounds, she turns to see the hummingbird suits approaching them. Kuvira turns the giant and fires at the hummingbird suits, but they were able to dodge the attack. Cut to Varrick and Zhu Li's suit as the fly to the giant's back.",12,4,51
Varrick,Aim for that spot in the middle of the back - the one I can never reach.,12,4,51
Zhu Li,Got it.,12,4,51
,"Zhu Li steers the suit to the mecha giant, attaching it to the body. Varrick readies the saws, but notices the mecha suit preparing to crush them.",12,4,51
Varrick,"Wah, let's get out of here! [Zhu Li steers the suit, narrowly avoiding being crushed.] Wow! I wish I had that kind of flexibility.",12,4,51
,"Asami steers her suit to the giant's leg. While her father prepares the saws, the giant prepares to crush them, forcing her to fly off. While the mecha giant tries to swat the hummingbird suits, Korra turns behind and sees a river with four bridges. She runs off to the river. While the mecha giant continues swatting the suits, Korra bends a large stream of water, freezing the mecha suit into place. The giant fires the spirit energy cannon, destroying one of the wings of Varrick and Zhu Li's suit.",12,4,51
Zhu Li,Hang on!,12,4,51
,"Zhu Li flips both ejection switches, throwing both pilots out of the suit as parachutes are deployed, while the suit crashes onto a building and explodes. Korra bends another stream of water and freezes the cannon arm. Asami pilots the suit to the portion of the mecha suit that is not frozen, while her father readies the saw.",12,4,51
Kuvira,I need more power! They're cutting in! More power!,12,4,51
,"The ice around the cannon arm begins to shatter. While Hiroshi continues cutting a hole, Asami looks on in worry as the ice continues shattering.",12,4,51
Asami,We need to get out of here.,12,4,51
Hiroshi,Almost there.,12,4,51
Asami,[As the shattered ice lands on the window.] We have to go now!,12,4,51
Hiroshi,[Concentrating.] Almost there. Almost there!,12,4,51
Asami,[Shocked as the arm breaks free.] Dad! Now!,12,4,51
Hiroshi,"Goodbye, Asami. I love you. [Flips the ejection switch of his daughter's seat.]",12,4,51
Asami,[As she is ejected with a shocked look.] Dad!,12,4,51
,"Asami looks in shock as the mecha giant crushes the hummingbird suit, causing it to fall off, revealing a hole on the leg cut by her father.",12,4,51
Korra,Hiroshi's plan worked. There's our opening.,12,4,51
,"Team Avatar runs up to the opening. Cut to the cockpit as Kuvira grunts in annoyance and swings the mecha suit's arm to crush the group, but Korra blocks the attack with an ice column. Kuvira doubles her bending and breaks free, but the group manages to jump into the hole, avoiding being crushed. Cut to the group inside the mecha giant as the arm leaves the hole. Close-up of Korra with a determined look.",12,4,51
,"As the title card fades, the scene opens on Kuvira's immobilized mecha suit trapped in ice. The scene zooms onto the targeting glass. Inside the cockpit, an infuriated Kuvira tries to break the ice. As the mecha tries to free itself, blocks of ice fall to the ground and shatter. Kuvira bends the mecha suit's right arm and grabs a piece of a nearby building for additional support. Finally, all of the ice breaks, enabling the mecha to move freely. As it moves down the street, a flashing light and siren sound loudly within the cockpit of the mecha. Kuvira, knowing what it means, yells to the pilots.",13,4,52
Kuvira,Initiate lockdown! Find the Avatar and whoever else is with her.,13,4,52
,Cut to the hole in the mecha suit's right knee. The alarm's flash can be seen and the siren heard.,13,4,52
Korra,"We need to move fast. Su, Lin, climb up to the arm and try to disable that weapon. Mako, Bolin, get to the engine and see if you can power this thing down. [Close-up on her.] I'm going after Kuvira.",13,4,52
Suyin,Are you sure? When you fought Kuvira before ...,13,4,52
Korra,"I know. [Cut to her as she looks down.] She almost destroyed me. [Determined, she looks up.] Not this time.",13,4,52
,"Cut to Mako and Bolin ascending the interior ladders while the Beifong siblings use their metal cables to launch themselves upward. Switch to a shot of the engine room, where the spirit vines are electrified and feeding power to the tank. Cut to a hatch which Bolin cuts open with a lava disc, allowing him and Mako to enter.",13,4,52
Mako,I'm going for that lever. You get the other one.,13,4,52
,"The brothers split, Bolin regenerating his lava disc. Mako confronts a guard.",13,4,52
Guard,Hey!,13,4,52
,"The guard shoots metal plates, which Mako dodges before throwing a fire blast at him. The guard shields himself with the metal plates. When he shoots more metal plates from his uniform, Mako tries to deflect with firebending, but his blast hits the spirit vine core, resulting in a small explosion, which throws the firebender into a pillar. He looks over to see Bolin blocking metal plates with the lava disc before turning to see more plates coming his own way. He dodges and kicks up fire before dodging additional attacks and shooting an additional arc of fire. Cut to Lin and Suyin continuing their ascent on their cables. They land on a small ramp and walk through the tunnel to see the cannon's operations. Close-up on them as metal plates are shot at them.",13,4,52
Lin,[To Suyin; ripping off nearby metal to shield them.] I'll deal with this guy! Disable the weapon!,13,4,52
,"She jumps to the ground and confronts the guard. Using a metallic extension of her armor, she blocks additional plates and moves toward him. She shoots a metal cable but the guard jumps backward and fires a fragment of metal at her that he ripped off the wall, but Lin kicks it away. Cut to Suyin as she watches the weapon operate, seeing bullets loaded into metallic holes. She uses her bending to bring down the chain of holes and watches as they tumble downward. The vine cartridges hit the bottom of the arm and explode, sending a mass of expanding purple energy screaming upward; Suyin is forced to jump toward the tunnel's entrance and duck to avoid the blast. After the explosion passes, she gets back up and smirks, seeing the cannon has been disabled. Lin returns to the scene.",13,4,52
Lin,[Looks around the scene and smiles.] Nice work.,13,4,52
Suyin,"The outside may be platinum, [Zoom out to show additional weapon parts.] but we can do a lot of damage in here.",13,4,52
,The siblings use their bending to begin collapsing the gears which control the suit. Cut to the cockpit.,13,4,52
Helmsman,The weapon's loading mechanism has malfunctioned. We're unable to fire.,13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Looking at the helmsman.] It's no malfunction. [Looks back to the window.] I can feel someone metalbending inside the arm. [She tries to move the arm as the scene moves to the mecha suit's exterior; the arm swings lazily at its side, unresponsive. Cut back to Kuvira.] I've lost the connection! The weapon's useless now. [Shifts to the left.]",13,4,52
,"The suit's right arm reaches for the left. As Kuvira bends, the right arm, after a moment, completely rends the unresponsive cannon arm from the side of the mecha. Cut to the Beifong siblings inside, slamming against the wall. Lin bends some of the metal to strap them down. As the scene cuts once again to the exterior, Kuvira throws the useless arm away and it crashes into a building. While the main body of the arm crashes straight to the ground, the cannon fractures from the arm and tumbles onward; a quick cut shows the cannon falling into the Spirit Wilds, where it vanishes from view. Zoom in on the other half at the base of the building, before focusing further in on the Beifongs, strapped in and unconscious. Switch to Kuvira in the cockpit, turning upon hearing a crash behind her. Zoom in on a hatch being pummeled from the other side by an unseen assailant; it gives out, flying through the air as the shot cuts to a view at Kuvira's back. As Korra emerges from the hatch, she immediately attacks with blasts of fire and air, knocking out the soldier; Korra lands and the Avatar and Kuvira begin to duel. She throws fire at the military leader, who dodges. She fires back with liquefied metal, which Korra manipulates and throws back at her, throwing her into the control panel. Kuvira quickly gets back up and charges, but Korra ducks. Kuvira turns and fires metal plates, but Korra dodges them. The metalbender shoots one of the radio speakers at the Avatar, who uses airbending to throw it out of danger. She bends an arc of fire at her foe, who jumps up and lands, bending the platform down, launching Korra into the air, who hits the roof and is locked in when Kuvira bends metal around her. The military leader bends the Avatar around the roof before throwing her into the control panel, smashing it. Just as Kuvira sets to attack again, Korra gets out of the way before being hit. She prepares to launch three metal fragments. Cut to the engine room as Mako and Bolin continue to duel against the guards with their firebending and lava disc, respectively. Mako dodges an attack and falls back to the wall as a large metal fragment is fired at him. He leans on the rail and throws fire back, knocking the guard down against the lever and throws him down again when he tries to recover. Mako reaches the lever.",13,4,52
Mako,I'm ready!,13,4,52
,"Cut to a close-up of Bolin pinned against a wall, trying to dodge attacks from his opponent while sustaining his lava disc.",13,4,52
Bolin,"Be with you in one second! Kind of busy! [Shoots his lava disc, which hits a steam pipe, releasing the fog into the room. As the guard recovers, a slow-mo shot shows Bolin charging and knocking him backward into the pipe. Loops around to reach Mako's sight. Zoom out toward Mako.] Okay, ready now!",13,4,52
,"Bolin makes his way to the lever. The scene changes to a split shot of the brothers looking at each other, their hands on the levers.",13,4,52
Mako,"One ... two ... three! [They pull the levers, but an angle from the roof shows that nothing happens to the engine.] Nothing's happening! [Runs toward his brother.]",13,4,52
Bolin,Kuvira must've done some override thing and taken control! [Zoom on his location as Mako approaches him. He removes his hands from the lever.],13,4,52
Mako,There's got to be some other way to shut down power from here.,13,4,52
Bolin,"[Looks down nervously at the controls as the shot zooms in on them. His fingers hovering over them, unsure.] Ummm ... [Switch back out to Mako overlooking him.]",13,4,52
Mako,Come on. You spent all that time working with Varrick and Baatar Jr. Didn't any of their genius rub off on you?,13,4,52
Bolin,"[Beads of sweat on his face; turns back to Mako.] Look, the only thing I know about these vines is that if you mess around with them too much, [Close-up on Mako.] they explode. [Mako moves his eyebrows together with a worried look on his face.]",13,4,52
Mako,[Looks nervously at the spirit vine core as the shot pans up on it. Cut back to him; he looks down and shuts his eyes briefly.] Get those engineers out of here. I have an idea.,13,4,52
Bolin,[Looks up at his brother.] Want to fill me in?,13,4,52
Mako,I'm gonna zap these vines with some electricity.,13,4,52
Bolin,"[Puts his hands up.] Let's back it up, okay? [Moves his hands around to prove his point.] I said that will make the vines explode.",13,4,52
Mako,Exactly. This is our only way of shutting this thing down. [Starts to walk away.] I can handle it.,13,4,52
Bolin,[Grasps his shoulder; switch to a shot of Mako turning to him.] No! You can't! This isn't the time to prove how awesome you are. I already know how awesome you are [Briefly looks away before looking back.] ... you're awesome.,13,4,52
Mako,"I don't have time to argue! [Fully turns to face Bolin.] I'm doing this, so get out of here!",13,4,52
Bolin,"[Close-up side-view. Bends his head down.] Okay, but for the record, [Looks back up.] I do not approve. Just, [Switch back toward Mako who is looking to the side.] get out as soon as you can. [Switch back as he raises his hand as Mako turns to him.] Promise?",13,4,52
Mako,[Close-up before a closer view of their hands as he grasps Bolin's and shakes it.] Promise. [The brothers embrace.],13,4,52
Bolin,I love you.,13,4,52
Mako,"[As they separate, hands still locked. Removing his arm around Bolin's shoulders] I love you, too. Now go!",13,4,52
,"Bolin runs off. The camera pans up the spirit vine core again before cutting back to a close-up of Mako, who takes his stance. Cut to Bolin as he hoists the engineers on his shoulders and returns to the hatch. He turns to see Mako generating lightning before stepping out of the shot. As Mako points two fingers at the ball, the charge crackling blue in the air around him, a bolt of lightning sparks at his fingertips and connects with the mass of vines. Arcs of purplish energy immediately spark off its surface; the arcs begin to detonate the walls of the room. Cut to Mako as his gaze is fixed on the surface of the mass, before cutting to behind him and panning up as the energy conduits above overload and detonate. The force of the blast sends Mako flying backward into the wall, but he sustains the lightning as he regains his stance, his gaze still fixed on his target. As the shot cuts once again to Mako's back, the entire mass flares with purple light and a surge comes off the vines that blasts him into the wall behind him. Another bright surge hits Mako around his arm, where it electrocutes and burns Mako, the sleeve of his uniform disintegrating and his skin turning a scalded red as an electric shockwave expands from his arm. He staggers, but manages to stay on his feet. Cut to a view of Mako with the empty hatch in the foreground; he makes his way toward it even as he maintains his assault on the mass of vines. As he draws near to the hatch, the mass sends another arc off its surface; it hits Mako directly in the chest and he immediately falls to the floor, his unconscious body half-draped over the hatch. A shot from above shows the mass of vines crackling and arcing angrily as Mako lies motionless below. Cut to an exterior view of the mecha, focused on the cockpit; blasts of flame flash from within as Korra and Kuvira duel. Cut to the interior. Staggering momentarily backward, Korra throws a blast of fire with a punch and dodges several metalbending attacks from Kuvira; they fly past her as Kuvira rotates into the frame. As soon as she does, Korra attacks her with airbending before sending a kick at Kuvira amplified by firebending. They miss as Kuvira dodges, spins around, her three orbs of metal floating next to her head, and sends multiple fragments of the metal at Korra. As Korra firebends at her from offscreen and Kuvira blocks the attack by reforming a shield with the metal from her orbs, the shot cuts to Korra as she stops firebending and jumps into the air, metalbending the shield down and kicking a gust of air at Kuvira, who tumbles backward and slams into the windows and control panel. Briefly staggered, she sends the shield at Korra, who ducks easily under it and physically attacks Kuvira, locking her legs around Kuvira's neck and flipping her over, throwing her backward onto the control platform, hitting the platform two times before rolling to a stop. Korra bends the metal beneath her, tossing her briefly limp form into the air. As Korra jumps into the air to land a crushing blow, the action becomes slow-motion and the shot cuts to Kuvira, now fully awake and seeing the oncoming Korra. As the shot cuts to a wide shot of both of them, still in slow-motion, Korra and Kuvira act simultaneously in midair, Korra airbending at Kuvira even as Kuvira bends a panel of the floor at Korra. The two blows land at the same time as the scene resumes normal time and both Korra and Kuvira are tossed away from each other by the combination of attacks, landing at opposite sides of the mecha's cockpit in clouds of dust and muffled yells. Cut to Mako, still unconscious far below the battle in the cockpit, the mass of vines growing ever more unstable. Rings of spirit energy spread outward on the roof of the room as Bolin climbs the ladder to the hatch, takes his brother over his shoulders, and jumps down to the landing below. The energy begins to seep out of the engine room as he lands; he keeps running even as the mass above sends arcs and beams of energy down through the ceiling above. As Bolin makes it to the ladder leading down toward the rest of the mecha, a massive explosion dismantles the ladder, sending it and them tumbling downward into the darkness below. Cut back to Korra and Kuvira; on the verge of landing another round of attacks, they are thrown off their feet as explosion rocks the floor beneath, purple light filling the windows on all sides. Cut to the exterior of the mecha as beams of energy blaze through the skin of the machine, shooting one-by-one in all directions and quickly becoming more and more numerous. A brilliant flash of light drowns the shot and promptly vanishes; a subtle crackle of suppressed energy crawls around the torso of the mecha before yielding to a ring of purple energy. With a massive blast of spirit energy set free, the mecha is torn by a devastating explosion, the top of its torso, now severed from its lower half, soaring through the air as the remaining usable arm, torn away, tumbles in the opposite direction. The scene cuts to Kora and Kuvira in the falling cockpit, holding desperately onto the railing around the control platform as debris flies past them toward the ceiling. As the shot cuts to the exterior once more, the cockpit section crashes into the street, raising a cloud of dust that suffuses the immediate area. As the dust settles, the upper section can be seen, motionless and useless, where it came to rest. A quick cut to Bolin and Mako, unconscious and lying side by side in the wreckage, is followed by a cut back to the outside as a blast of earthbending clears a path out of the cockpit. Korra helps Kuvira out of the ruined cockpit, its window shattered and its frames bent, and sets her down as Kuvira lets out a groan. Korra sits down, spent, next to her and addresses her.",13,4,52
Korra,"It's over. [Korra looks up with hardened eyes.] You're gonna call off your army [Cuts to Kuvira who opens her eyes.] and surrender to President Raiko. [Kuvira's eyes dart to Korra, filled with hatred.] Then you and —",13,4,52
,"Catching Korra off guard, Kuvira bends a chunk of rock at her, catching her in the face and sending her flying across the pile of debris. She comes to a stop face down in the street; with a groan, she lifts her head and sees Kuvira escaping down the street, limping badly. After a quick glance behind her, Kuvira takes off down the street toward the Spirit Wilds in the distance, her arm braced across her body.",13,4,52
Korra,Stop!,13,4,52
,"Kuvira does not comply. After a moment, Korra angrily rises to her feet and gives chase. Cut to Kuvira rounding a corner at the entrance to the Wilds; she braces herself on the side of a building with her arm before falling to the ground with a groan. Rising to her feet once more, she continues into the forest, limping and holding her side. She pauses for a moment to catch her breath, holding herself up with a hand against a tree. She looks up as Korra's voice permeates the trees.",13,4,52
Korra,[Voice-over.] Kuvira! Give up!,13,4,52
Kuvira,"[As the shot focuses on her face, her eyes narrowing and her voice defiant.] Never.",13,4,52
,"She resumes walking, still limping. As she takes her free hand and pushes aside a curtain of vines, she gasps, beholding what lies beyond; her eyes narrow and her mouth curls into a sneer. Cut to Korra, walking through the forest as sunlight filters through gaps in the canopy above onto the vine-covered street.",13,4,52
Korra,"Please, stop this madness! It has to end now!",13,4,52
,"As Korra jumps to the top of a root, Kuvira's voice echoes through the forest; she turns her head, trying to find its source.",13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Off-screen.] If you really want to end it, then come and get me!",13,4,52
,"Korra takes off in pursuit of the source of the sound. Ducking under a large, arch-like root and pushing through a clump of bushes, she comes upon a clearing and, looking up, gasps in horror. The shot cuts, sliding from the base to the open end of the massive spirit weapon's barrel, suspended in a cradle of vines where it fell from the discarded arm of the mecha. Its barrel is aimed directly at Korra, who stands motionless before it. Cut to Kuvira, holding to the side of the firing mechanism, holding the manual trigger handle in her left hand.",13,4,52
Kuvira,Now it's over.,13,4,52
Korra,"[Extending a hand, desperate.] Don't!",13,4,52
,"Kuvira slides the trigger home and the shot once again slides down the barrel to the end, where the devastating purple beam builds within the barrel. In slow-motion, Korra abandons her attempt at reasoning and dives for safety as the barrel discharges, its beam colliding with the ground and throwing Korra aside after hitting the ground a few times. She comes to a stop and looks up. The beam has not stopped; it continues to pierce the ground, the ground flaming at the impact point. Cut to Kuvira, standing with one foot on the weapon and one foot on a vine. As the weapon continues to fire below, the vines around her begin to glow with the same purple light and she looks around at them as the shot cuts to a wide shot of the cannon. The force of the firing has propelled the cannon backward, away from the ground; now it twists around, wildly swinging in its cradle of vines as the beam follows. Cut to a shot of the city, the Spirit Wilds in the foreground, as the beam flies upward through the trees, slicing through buildings and detonating them, before cutting back to the uncontrollable cannon as Kuvira holds on to it. Cut to Korra.",13,4,52
Korra,[Yelling over the noise of the cannon.] Shut it down!,13,4,52
Kuvira,[Sliding the trigger back to find the weapon unresponsive.] I can't!,13,4,52
,"A sudden shudder of the cannon throws Kuvira from its side; she yells as she tumbles to the ground, hitting it multiple times. Raising her head, she gasps, her expression morphing into horror as she beholds the barrel of her creation swinging around to aim at her, the beam still firing. As it bears down on her, Korra jumps in from the left, throwing herself between the beam and Kuvira. As Kuvira watches, terrified, Korra extends her hands before her, her eyes glowing as she enters the Avatar State. The beam of energy abruptly gives way, and a spherical mass of energy forms around the two, while smaller energy beams spray in all directions. Kuvira sits motionless, caught between wonder and terror as the purplish-white light courses around them. The shot moves behind them. As Korra continues to bend the beam, the orb of energy around them begins to expand, slowly at first, then exponentially. The two disappear when the orb glows bright white and flares into a massive size. The shot cuts to a wide shot of the Spirit Wilds and the central peninsula of Republic City itself as the glowing orb suddenly explodes into being, swallowing the city and drowning the light of the midday sun as it grows ever larger and a shockwave radiates outward at its base, clouds wrapping its top. As it expands through the streets, washing over the debris of the attack and the remains of the monstrous mecha, the shot shows Tenzin and his children taking shelter in a building as the threshold of the orb blazes past them, ash and dust pouring through the doorway. Cut to Asami as she rounds a corner and comes upon the orb; her eyes widen in shock, and she ducks into a underground tunnel as the orb washes over the street above and smoke envelops her as well. Cut to a wide shot as the orb reaches the height of its expansion. As the scene cuts to a street below, the rapid expansion of the cloud of dust and debris kicked up by the orb comes to a sudden standstill, the cloud hanging lazily in midair for a moment before reversing its direction and screaming back toward its source. The next events happen very quickly. A second of silence as the shot switches to an overhead view of the orb, it begins to collapse on itself, leaving circular clouds hanging in the sky and revealing a layer of vines covering the ground. The orb utterly implodes, crushing itself down to microscopic size as it sucks the clouds inward to itself, leaving only a golden pinpoint sitting at the center of a deep crater covered with vines. A brief flare of golden light flickers out and the world is bathed in a golden glow as a yellowish beam of energy erupts skyward, a beacon rising into the sky as Kuvira's army of mecha suits watches from the streets of the city. Within the beam rise two coiled ribbons of green and yellow, two helices spiraling upward into the sky above. Cut to its base, where a rotating orb shines greenish-yellow on the ground at the base of the beacon, followed by the debris of the mecha suit as Bolin and a semiconscious Mako open a hatch and emerge from the heart of the wreck. Bolin gasps as Mako turns his head toward it.",13,4,52
Bolin,Look!,13,4,52
,"As they stare in wonder at the beacon, the shot cuts to Tenzin and his children walking toward the spiraling light.",13,4,52
Tenzin,[Astonished.] A new spirit portal.,13,4,52
,"Fade to the rim of the crater, where a group of mecha tanks have gathered; a captain gives orders.",13,4,52
Mecha suit captain,[To his unit.] Spread out and find Kuvira!,13,4,52
,"As they disperse, the shot cuts to within the crater. Lin, Suyin, Varrick, and Zhu Li have climbed onto the remains of the enormous mecha, looking around. Cut to Asami and Tenzin; the shot pans left as Asami straightens up, Ikki and Meelo landing behind her.",13,4,52
Mako,Korra!,13,4,52
,"Tenzin, meanwhile, walks toward the smashed cockpit, where Mako stands as well. Mako steps inside the cockpit and the shot cuts to follow him. He peers up toward the wrecked control surface, where Jinora stands looking down at him. As the shot cuts to a close-up of her face, she shakes her head. Cut back to Mako as he turns to Tenzin.",13,4,52
Mako,"Tenzin, there's no sign of her.",13,4,52
Tenzin,"Keep looking! Korra! [Cut to a wide shot as he bellows loudly, his voice echoing across the waste.] Korra!",13,4,52
,"Cut to Korra, floating unconscious in spirit-form as her hair ruffles. After a moment, she opens her eyes and finds herself facing a red reflection of herself, a bluish boundary separating the two. As the two reflections regard each other, her red reflection fluctuates, morphing into an unconscious Kuvira. As Korra looks at her, the blue color around them starts to dissolve and Korra looks around at the world materializing around her as they lose their respective colors, returning to their normal forms. They slowly descend onto the landscape around the new spirit portal, a field of purple flowers and mangled-looking reddish trees; they are in the Spirit World. As they touch down, Kuvira groans and topples. Korra catches her and holds the unconscious woman in her arms. When Kuvira comes to, she realizes who is holding her and lets out a panicked cry, before scrambling away, pushing Korra over. On her feet, Kuvira looks around at the new environment. The scene cuts to a wide shot. Kuvira, disoriented, climbs to her feet.",13,4,52
Kuvira,What happened? Are we ... dead?,13,4,52
Korra,"[Stands up.] No, we're okay, but we're in the Spirit World. [Raises her arms to gestures around them.] All the energy from your weapon tore open a new portal and blasted us in here.",13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Cuts to a close-up of Kuvira as she lowers her head and looks away.] Why would you save my life, after everything I did to you?",13,4,52
Korra,"[Surprised, she looks down before gazing at Kuvira.] I guess ... I see a lot of myself in you.",13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Cuts to a sideways close-up. First surprised, but gradually becomes angry.] We are nothing alike!",13,4,52
Korra,"[Cuts to a sideways close-up; calmly.] Yes, we are. We're both fierce and determined to succeed, [Sadly lowers her head.] sometimes without thinking things through.",13,4,52
Kuvira,"This wasn't how I wanted things to end. [Falls to her knees.] If you would have all just surrendered, [Straightens up a little, glaring at the Avatar.] none of this would have happened.",13,4,52
Korra,"[Slowly walks toward her. Close-up.] You brought this on yourself. Messing with the spirit vines, acting like a dictator over your people ... you had to know what you were doing wasn't right.",13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Angrily, glaring at the Avatar.] I was trying to help my people. Su turned her back on the Earth Kingdom, you were gone! I had to do something.",13,4,52
,The shot switches to a view of the back left side of Kuvira's head and the upper body of the Avatar.,13,4,52
Korra,[Softly.] I think I get it now.,13,4,52
Kuvira,[Turns away from Korra.] You don't understand anything about me.,13,4,52
Korra,I do. [Sadly looks down.] Su told me how she took you in when you were younger. [Looks away.] It must have been so hard being an orphan.,13,4,52
Kuvira,"[She angrily turns her head toward Korra as the shot cuts to a wide view.] Don't pretend you know what it felt like! [Wildly, waving her free arm.] The Avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents like I meant nothing to them. [Cuts to a close-up of the left side of Kuvira's face.] How could I just stand by [Starts crying.] and watch the same thing happen to my nation, when it needed someone to guide it?",13,4,52
Korra,"[Voice-over.] You wanted to create a place where you and your people would never be vulnerable again. [Kuvira raises her head to look at Korra as the shot switches to a close-up of the Avatar.] I may not have been an orphan, but believe me, I understand what it feels like to be afraid. [Sits down so she is at eye level with Kuvira.] After I was poisoned, I would have done anything to feel in control.",13,4,52
,"The look on Kuvira's face softens. Cut to the physical world, where all sorts of spirits fly out of the portal and reappear on the rim of the crater.",13,4,52
Tenzin,The spirits have returned.,13,4,52
Asami,"[Turns to the portal, from which Korra emerges, helping Kuvira to walk.] And so has Korra! [Cut to where Kuvira's mecha suits turn to the portal.]",13,4,52
Bolin,"[He runs up along with Asami and Tenzin, laughing excitedly.] You're okay!",13,4,52
Mecha suit captain,"[Korra and Kuvira look around as the mecha suits gather around them, pointing their weapons at them.] Release Kuvira, or we will attack! [Cuts to an overhead view.]",13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Cuts back to Korra and Kuvira as she removes her arm from Korra's shoulder and addresses her troops.] Stand down. This battle is over. I owe the Avatar my life. [Cuts to scene behind Tenzin and Bolin.] Her power is beyond anything I could ever hope to achieve. [Cuts to a close-up of Kuvira looking down, and Su looks at her.] I'll accept whatever punishment the world sees fit.",13,4,52
,The mecha suits all stand down and Kuvira is handcuffed by Lin.,13,4,52
Kuvira,"[Turns to Suyin, who looks up after being addressed.] And Su, I'm sorry for all the anguish I've caused you and your family.",13,4,52
Suyin,You're going to answer for everything you've done.,13,4,52
,"Lin and Suyin take Kuvira away, while everyone else hugs Korra. The shot cuts to a wider shot of the crater. With the spirits flying happily ahead.",13,4,52
Bolin,"[Voice-over.] And though the battle took a severe toll on our beloved city, out of the destruction, love did bloom! [Fade to Varrick and Zhu Li's wedding, where Bolin is marrying the couple.] So that is why, dearest friends and family, we gather today to celebrate the wondrous, and at time inexplicable bond between Sir Varrick and the Lady Zhu Li!",13,4,52
Varrick,"[Looks over to cameraman, who is filming the crowd; in a loud whisper.] Hey, pal, camera on me! This is my big day! [The camera is swiveled around and Varrick nods to Bolin to continue.]",13,4,52
Bolin,"True love is a fickle creature. [Cut to Bolin's friends and family in the audience.] Difficult to find, nearly impossible to tame. [Close-up on Varrick and Zhu Li.] But Varrick and Zhu Li have proven that even the longest of long shots [Varrick glances at Bolin, annoyed.] can have a chance at happiness together. Now, for the vows! [Pabu climbs on top of Bolin's shoulder with a small scroll around his neck.] Thank you, Master Pabu. Do you, Sir Iknik Blackstone Varrick of the Southern Water Tribe, Master of the High Seas, take the Lady Zhu Li Moon to be your lawfully wedded wife? Will you promise to treat her not as your assistant, but as your honored and cherished partner?",13,4,52
Varrick,You're darn tootin' I do!,13,4,52
Bolin,"And do you, Zhu Li, take Varrick, to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to care for him, in sickness and in health, [Looks down to note and gets a confused expression on his face.] and also scrub his callouses on a bi-weekly basis, which ... isn't really that much to ask ... [Crumples paper; to Varrick, annoyed.] Okay, I'm not reading all this.",13,4,52
Zhu Li,[Close-up as she stares lovingly at her groom.] I do take Varrick. Callouses and all.,13,4,52
Bolin,"You may now [Varrick and Zhu Li lean in close together, Bolin takes a few steps back. Softly.] do the thing.",13,4,52
,"Varrick and Zhu Li kiss, while the crowd applauds. Cut back to Varrick and Zhu Li, when Varrick begins to cry.",13,4,52
Zhu Li,Are you all right?,13,4,52
Varrick,You just make me so dang happy!,13,4,52
,"He wipes his tears away and pulls a remote from his pocket. Pressing the button, a bunch of fireworks is set off, which is shown in a far shot of the Air Temple Island courtyard. The scene fades to later that night, when the people have shifted from in front of the makeshift altar to a dance floor with tables in front of it. Tahno, Lu, Gang, the council page, and the White Falls Wolfbats provide the music. Varrick is dancing with Zhu Li, while Ikki is dancing with a reluctant Huan. Opal drags Bolin onto the dance floor as well. Lin takes some food from a waiter, while Pema chases Rohan. Pan to Mako and Wu.",13,4,52
Mako,"My cousin told me how level-headed you were during the whole evacuation. I got to admit, I'm impressed. I think you're going to make a great leader. [In a berating tone.] But that doesn't mean I'm gonna set you up with Korra, so don't ask.",13,4,52
Wu,"[Cuts to Wu.] That's okay, Mako. Sometimes, a good evacuation is its own reward. [Cut to Korra, who joins them as the two turn to face her.]",13,4,52
Korra,"Good to see you, Prince Wu. Or should I say, King Wu? You ready to get back to Ba Sing Se and finally take the throne?",13,4,52
Wu,"Yeah [He looks down at the ground, briefly.] ... about that [He rubs the back of his head.] ... I was actually thinking of stepping down as king and getting rid of the monarchy all together. [He gets bewildered looks from Mako and Korra.]",13,4,52
Mako,[Surprised.] Are ... you joking?,13,4,52
Wu,"For once, [Shakes his head.] I'm not. Now I know what you're gonna say, I'm being lazy, I'm afraid of responsibility, I'm putting my singing career before my people, but it's none of those things. I really think the Earth Kingdom would be better off if the states were independent and had elected leaders, like the United Republic.",13,4,52
Mako,[Cut to Mako and Korra. Still surprised as Korra smiles.] That's ... actually pretty wise and mature of you.,13,4,52
Korra,"I think it's a great idea. The Earth Kingdom should evolve, and I'll do everything in my power to help you make that happen.",13,4,52
Wu,"[Makes a saluting gesture to Korra.] Looking forward to working with you. But for now, the dance floor calls. [He scoots off.]",13,4,52
Korra,"[To Mako, after a brief pause.] How's the arm?",13,4,52
Mako,Much better.,13,4,52
Korra,"[Close-up.] The words ""thank you"" don't feel big enough for what you did. But I honestly don't know what else to say.",13,4,52
Mako,"[Cut to a sideways close-up on the left side of his face.] You don't need to say anything. I want you to know, I'll follow you into battle, no matter how crazy things get. I've got your back [Cut to Korra who is touched.] ... and I always will [Korra smiles.].",13,4,52
,"Cut to the decorated gate at the entrance to the island, where Korra is leaning against it alone, looking at the city across the water as the portal rises into the sky beyond. Tenzin walks up to Korra.",13,4,52
Tenzin,"I spoke to President Raiko. [Korra turns to look at him.] Tomorrow, he's announcing a plan to expand the city, rather than rebuild downtown.",13,4,52
Korra,[Cuts to look at the spirit portal.] I bet Aang never could have imagined there'd be a spirit portal right in the heart of Republic City.,13,4,52
Tenzin,"[Cuts back as he looks at her.] Korra, you've transformed the world more in a few years than most Avatars did during their lifetimes.",13,4,52
Korra,[Close-up on Korra as she looks down.] But I feel like I've only just begun. [Looks at Tenzin.] There's so much more I want to learn and do.,13,4,52
Tenzin,"[Cuts to Tenzin looking at Korra, smiling.] You don't know how happy I am to hear you so full of hope again.",13,4,52
Korra,"[Cut to a wide shot with the wedding altar behind them.] It's been a bit of a bumpy ride, huh?",13,4,52
Tenzin,"I've come to realize life is one, big, bumpy ride.",13,4,52
Korra,"[Cuts to Korra who pauses.] I know I was in a pretty dark place after I was poisoned. But I finally understand why I had to go through all that. I needed to understand what true suffering was so I could be more compassionate to others, even to people like Kuvira.",13,4,52
,Tenzin puts a reassuring hand on Korra's shoulder. Korra puts her hand on his and comes to peace.,13,4,52
Asami,"[Interrupts them.] Excuse me Tenzin, Varrick is looking for you. Something about wanting to borrow a glidersuit to fly off the tower?",13,4,52
Tenzin,[Runs off.] That doesn't seem like a good idea!,13,4,52
Korra,[To Asami.] Wanna sit with me for a minute? I'm not ready to get back to the party just yet. [Asami smiles and they sit down side by side on the steps with Naga sleeping near them.] I don't think I ever really apologized.,13,4,52
Asami,"[Surprised, she turns to Korra.] For what?",13,4,52
Korra,For being gone all that time. For not coming back sooner. [Looks down in shame.],13,4,52
Asami,[Turns her body toward Korra; firmly.] You don't need to apologize for anything. [Korra looks at her.] I'm just so happy you're here now. [She looks away; emotionally] I don't think I could have handled losing you and my father in the same day. [Tears well up in Asami's eyes as the scene cuts to a close-up of them both.],13,4,52
Korra,I am so sorry for what happened. [Hugs Asami.],13,4,52
Asami,[Wipes away the tears.] Thank you. I'm just glad I was able to forgive him. [The scene widens to feature their hug.],13,4,52
Korra,"[As they let go.] So, what now? Back to the dance floor?",13,4,52
Asami,"I'm kind of all danced out. Honestly, after everything that's happened the past few months, I could use a vacation.",13,4,52
Korra,"[Lightens up and smiles.] Let's do it! Let's go on a vacation, just the two of us. Anywhere you want.",13,4,52
Asami,[Surprised.] Really? Okay ... I've always wanted to see what the Spirit World's like.,13,4,52
Korra,Sounds perfect.,13,4,52
,"Fade to the base of the new spirit portal, where Korra and Asami walk up to it. Both are back in their normal attire, carrying a backpack. Stopping for a moment a few meters short of the portal, they turn their heads and smile at each other. The shot cuts to behind and between them as they join hands and walk into the portal, where they turn to face each other closely, gazing into each other's eyes. The camera pans up into the portal's beam of light as the Chinese characters ""The End"" appear on screen.",13,4,52
